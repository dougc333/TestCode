function H = RANSACFit(p1, p2, match, maxIter, seedSetSize, maxInlierError, goodFitThresh )
%RANSACFit Use RANSAC to find a robust affine transformation
% Input:
%   p1: N1 * 2 matrix, each row is a point
%   p2: N2 * 2 matrix, each row is a point
%   match: M * 2 matrix, each row represents a match [index of p1, index of p2]
%   maxIter: the number of iterations RANSAC will run
%   seedNum: The number of randomly-chosen seed points that we'll use to fit
%   our initial circle
%   maxInlierError: A match not in the seed set is considered an inlier if
%                   its error is less than maxInlierError. Error is
%                   measured as sum of Euclidean distance between transformed 
%                   point1 and point2. You need to implement the
%                   ComputeCost function.
%
%   goodFitThresh: The threshold for deciding whether or not a model is
%                  good; for a model to be good, at least goodFitThresh
%                  non-seed points must be declared inliers.

% Output:
%   H: a robust estimation of affine transformation from p1 to p2

%      pt2.
%   pt1: N1 x 2 matrix where each ROW is a data point [x_i, y_i]

%   match: M x 2 matrix, each row represents a match [index of pt1, index of pt2]

% Output:
%    dists: An M x 1 vector where dists(i) is the error of fitting the i-th

%           Error is measured as the Euclidean distance between (transformed pt1)
