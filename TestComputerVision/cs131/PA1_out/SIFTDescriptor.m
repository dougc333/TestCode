% location with detected key points' scale and angle
%
% INPUT:
%   pyramid: Image pyramid. pyramid{i} is a rescaled version of the
%            original image, in grayscale double format
%
%   keyPtLoc: N * 2 matrix, each row is a key point pixel location in
%   pyramid{round(keyPtScale)}. So pyramid{round(keyPtScale)}(y,x) is the center of the keypoint
%
%   keyPtScale: N * 1 matrix, each entry holds the index in the Gaussian
%   pyramid for the keypoint. Earlier code interpolates things, so this is a
%   double, but we'll just round it to an integer.

    % Precompute the gradients at all pixels of all pyramid scales
    
    % This is a cell array, which is like an ArrayList that holds matrices.
