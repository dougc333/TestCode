when computing a fft of a signal; the assumption is you are calculating in whole periods. 
Non integer periods lead to discontunities 
and introduce high frequency components higher than the nyquist frequency

windowing reduces the effect of these high frequency discontuinities; 
the worst window is a box type function which adds an edge discontunity at the edge. 
a more commonly used approximation is a smooth curve which tapers to 0. This reduces the high frequency artifact problem.
