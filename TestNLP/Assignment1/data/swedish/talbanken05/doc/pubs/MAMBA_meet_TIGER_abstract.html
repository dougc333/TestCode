<h2>Joakim Nivre, Johan Hall, Jens Nilsson: MAMBA meets TIGER: reconstructing a Swedish treebank from antiquity  </h2>
Treebanks have become an essential resource for the development,
optimization and evaluation of broad-coverage syntactic parsers. Given
that the number of languages for which treebanks are available is
growing steadily, there is a remarkable lack of treebank resources for
the Nordic languages with the notable exception of Danish, which is
blessed with not only one but two treebanks of substantial size (the
VISL Arboretum and the Danish Dependency Treebank). For Swedish, the
lack of resources is especially surprising, since some of the earliest
examples of syntactically annotated corpora, Talbanken in the 70's
(Einarsson 1976a, 1976b) and SynTag in the 80's (Järborg 1986), were
based on Swedish data. Talbanken contains close to 300,000 words of
both written and spoken Swedish, manually annotated with partial phrase
structure and grammatical functions according to the MAMBA scheme
(Teleman 1974), and was a very impressive achievement at the time of
its creation. By modern standards, however, Talbanken is probably best
characterized as a "proto-treebank", since the annotation format makes
it rather difficult to use with contemporary parsers and treebank
tools.
<p> In this paper, we report on a project aiming at the reconstruction
of Talbanken in a modern framework. The purpose of the project is
twofold. First of all, by converting Talbanken to a more usable format,
we want to create a useful resource for research on syntactic parsing
of Swedish. Secondly, we want to see whether Talbanken can be used to
realize the notion of a theory-supporting treebank, in the sense of
Nivre (2003), i.e. a richly annotated source treebank from which we can
generate target treebanks in different theoretical frameworks. More
precisely, the goal is to extract two treebanks from Talbanken, one
with phrase structure annotation, and one with dependency annotation. </p><p> The MAMBA annotation scheme consists of two layers, the first
being a lexical analysis, consisting of part-of-speech information
including morphological features, and the second being a syntactic
analysis, in terms of grammatical functions. Both layers are flat in
the sense that they consist of tags assigned to individual word tokens,
but the syntactic layer also gives information about constituent
structure, as exemplified in the annotation of the sentence <i>Genom skattereformen införs individuell beskattning av arbetsinkomster</i> (Through the tax reform, individual taxation of work income is introduced): 
</p><pre>*GENOM                  PR        AAPR        
SKATTEREFORMEN          NNDDSS    AA          
INFÖRS                  VVPSSMPA  FV          
INDIVIDUELL             AJ        SSAT        
BESKATTNING             VN        SS          
AV                      PR        SSETPR      
ARBETSINKOMSTER         NN        SSET        
.                       IP        IP          
</pre>                        
<p> The first column of annotation is the lexical analysis, while the
second column is the syntactic analysis. The grammatical subject of the
sentence is the phrase <i>individuell beskattning av arbetsinkomster</i> (individual taxation of work income), where the head word <i>beskattning</i> (taxation) is assigned the simple tag SS for subject, while the pre-modifying adjective <i>individuell</i> (individual) is tagged SS and AT for adjectival modifier; in the post-modifying prepositional phrase, the noun <i>arbetsinkomster</i> (work income) is tagged SS and ET for post-modifier, while the preposition <i>av</i> (of) is tagged SS, ET and PR for preposition.
</p><p> The syntactic analysis in MAMBA represents an eclectic approach
based on dependency grammar, Diderichsen's field model and immediate
constituent analysis (Teleman 1974). This makes it very suitable as a
source annotation for conversion to both phrase structure and
dependency annotation. The conversion proceeds in three steps:
</p><p>    1. The original flat but multi-layered annotation is 
converted to a bare phrase structure annotation, i.e. 
a phrase structure with unlabeled nonterminal nodes, 
and edges labeled with grammatical functions. This
conversion is relatively straightforward given the
partially hierarchic annotation exemplified above.
</p><p>    2. The bare phrase structure annotation is extended to a
full phrase structure representation by labeling
nonterminal nodes with syntactic categories. These
categories are not part of the original MAMBA annotation
and have to be inferred from other parts of the
annotation.
</p><p>    3. The full phrase structure annotation is converted to a
dependency annotation using the standard technique with
head-finding rules (Magerman 1995, Collins 1996) and
preserving grammatical functions as edge labels.
Head-finding rules are not part of the original
annotation scheme and have to be constructed manually.
</p><p> The extracted treebanks will be encoded in TIGER-XML, and the
phrase structure version will in fact be very close to the NEGRA/TIGER
annotation scheme for German (Brants et al. 2002), an adaptation of
which has previously been applied to Swedish by Volk and Samuelsson
(2004). This scheme allows discontinuous phrases, which do occur in the
MAMBA annotation, and has edges labeled with grammatical functions. The
dependency version, which consists of terminal nodes connected by edges
labeled with grammatical functions, will also be encoded in TIGER-XML,
following the guidelines endorsed by the Nordic Treebank Network
(Kromann 2004). The reconstructed treebank, in both versions, will be
made freely available for research and educational purposes. We are
planning a first release in connection with NODALIDA 2005.
