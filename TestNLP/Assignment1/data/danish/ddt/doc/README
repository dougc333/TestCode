1. Preamble

    1.1 Source
	
	The Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) is available from
	http://www.id.cbs.dk/~mtk/treebank/
		
	We used the Malt-XML version produced by Joakim Nivre et al.

    1.2 Copyright

	The Danish Dependency Treebank is copyrighted material.

	    * (c) 2002-2004 by Matthias Trautner Kromann
	      (http://www.id.cbs.dk/~mtk) and the Department of
	      Computational Linguistics at the Copenhagen Business
	      School (http://www.id.cbs.dk), who own the copyright to
	      all dependency annotations in the Danish Dependency
	      Treebank.

	    * (c) 1998 by the Society for Danish Language and
	      Literature (http://www.dsl.dk), who own the copyright to
	      the underlying PAROLE corpus and the "msd" and "lemma"
	      annotations.

	The dependency annotations in the Danish Dependency Treebank
	were carried out in 2002-2003 by Matthias Trautner Kromann
	with the assistance of Stine Kern Lynge and Line Hove
	Mikkelsen.

	The PAROLE corpus was collected by Ole Norling-Christensen and
	the Society for Danish Language and Literature, and consists
	of quotations of 150-250 words from a wide range of randomly
	selected linguistically representative Danish texts from
	1983-1992. The copyright to these quotations belongs to the
	authors of the original texts, and their inclusion in the
	PAROLE corpus is licensed by §22 in the Danish law on
	Copyright (lovbekendtgørelse nr.  618 af 27. juni 2001) which
	states that it is permitted to quote from copyrighted works
	according to a "fair use" principle. The source of each
	quotation is listed in the DTAG encoded treebank files (for
	technical reasons, meta information cannot be encoded in the
	corresponding TIGER-XML encoded treebank files).

    1.3 License

	The copyright owners of the Danish Dependency Treebank
	(M.T. Kromann, the Department of Computational Linguistics,
	and the Society for Danish Language and Literature) grant you
	the right to use the Danish Dependency Treebank free of charge

    2.1 Data format

    	Data adheres to the following rules:

    	* Data files contain one or more sentences separated by a
	  blank line.

    	* A sentence consists of one or tokens, each one starting on a
	  new line.

    	* A token consists of ten fields described in the table
	  below. Fields are separated by one tab character.

	* All data files will contains these ten fields, although only
          the ID, FORM, CPOSTAG, POSTAG, HEAD and DEPREL columns are
          guaranteed to contain non-underscore values for all
          languages.

	* Data files are are UTF-8 encoded (unicode).


	Field 1: ID 	

	    Token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence.

	Field 2: FORM

	    Word form or punctuation symbol

	Field 3: LEMMA 	

	    Stem of word form. Not available for Danish, so contains
	    always an underscore.

	Field 4: CPOSTAG 

	    Coarse-grained part-of-speech tag.
