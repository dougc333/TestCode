The explanation of a dependency parser is not useful in the coursera class materials. 
The test.py code doesnt run using badfeatures.model. 


Assumption: under XX assumptions the dependency parser outperforms CFGs and Probabilistic CFGs. 

There is no readme in the code or unit tests to indicate funtionality making debugging difficult
