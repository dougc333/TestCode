They were seen to succeed in living a sexually pure life as part of this .  There was some extension of the pietistic ideal .  Sodalities , such as the Legion of Mary , Opus Dei , and Christian Life communities , have partially extended this form of commitment to some , particularly more middle - class laity , and continue to have an important role in <head>activating</head> laity for what are judged to be religious goals both personally and socially . But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .

Gilbert refers to a dissertation by Richard Allen Soloway which shows contemporary fears of Christianity falling before the atheistical ,  licentious ,  and immoral foreigner  ( Sexual Deviance and Disaster ,  98 ,  99 ,  1001 ,  11011 )  .  The sodomite becomes a virulent image of this threat ,  embodying a foreign infection which in turn is linked to social disorder and economic collapse at home .  A violent , enduring mythology is <head>activated</head> to make sense of immediate socio - political crisis and fear . This analysis suggests that if ,  in periods of intensified conflict ,  crisis is displaced on to the deviant ,  the process only succeeds because of the paranoid instabilities at the heart of dominant cultural identities .  Further ,  such displacements of non - sexual fears on to the sexual deviant ,  be he or she actual ,  imagined ,  or constituted in and by the displacement ,  are made possible because other kinds of transgression  political ,  religious  are not only loosely associated with the sexual deviant ,  but condensed in the very definition of deviance .

After trying various neurotransmitters the group found that serotonin could potentiate the cell 's  response  ie  enhance the response to stimulation .  The difference between long and short term memory depends on whether certain NMDA  (  N  methyl - D - aspartate )  receptors were activated or not. A stronger ( long ) serotonin stimulus causes the release of amino acids which <head>activate</head> the NMDA receptors , leading to long term memory . A short stimulus gives only a transient NMDA elevation ,  but if the cells are treated with both serotonin and NMDA ,  then long term potentiation could be induced .  The team also found that long term potentiation led to the persistent elevation of cAMP in the cells ,  while short term potentiation was associated with only a transient elevation of cAMP .

The suggestion that pre - exposure to a stimulus establishes an exact representation of it ,  for instance ,  is not in itself enough to explain latent inhibition ;  indeed it seems capable of predicting quite the wrong result .  The ability of the CS to evoke the CR after conditioning trials have been given will depend ,  in part ,  upon that stimulus being identified with the one that was presented during conditioning .  To the extent that this identification is more likely to be made when the stimulus in question is already capable of <head>activating</head> a detailed representation , the likelihood of a vigorous CR may be increased . What we have already seen ,  however ,   ( p. 24 )  is that pre - exposure to the to - be - CS results in retarded  development of the CR .  Clearly ,  this aspect of our account of habituation is not enough in itself to explain the latent inhibition effect .

All the accounts of latent inhibition discussed so far have assumed that what is learned during pre - exposure interferes with the formation of the CS - US association .  Revusky  ( 1971 )  call his theory a concurrent  interference theory to emphasize just this point and to distinguish it from another commonly held interpretation of proactive interference .  According to this alternative view , the target association may be formed perfectly normally but since , on a subsequent test trial , both this and any previously learned association will become <head>activated</head> when the CS is presented , the subjects may fail to retrieve the correct one and the likelihood of the CR will be reduced . Indeed ,  the effects of retrieval failure may also be evident during the course of conditioning itself because any trial after the first can be viewed as being a test trial on which the subject is required to retrieve information acquired on earlier trials .  Clearly the retrieval - failure hypothesis will make many of the same predictions as other theories of latent inhibition .

Thus both A and B could become directly linked with a representation of stimulus X as shown in Fig 5.10 ( a )  .  Subsequent training with A followed by an unconditioned stimulus  ( US )  might allow the formation of an association between the associatively activated representation of X and the US .  Thus B would become capable of activating the US representation ( and of evoking a CR ) by way of its ability to <head>activate</head> the X representation . A and B might well have features in common from the outset  ( the c  elements in the figure )  and these will produce primary generalization  training on A will give associative strength to stimulus elements that are present also in B. The X representation functions in just the same way as the c  elements in producing generalization except for the fact that the ability of A and B to activate X is based on prior conditioning .  It should be acknowledged that not all theories of Pavlovian learning are entirely happy with the suggestion that an associatively activated representation can form an excitatory link with the  ( directly activated )  representation of some other event .

Recent research in tumour promotion backs up this objection .  Tumour promoters are substances such as the phorbolesters that are n't carcinogenic by themselves but encourage the growth of malignant tumours in cells that have previously been exposed to a low dose of a true carcinogen  ( known as an initiator )  .  Researchers have now discovered that even by themselves , promoters can stimulate cells to produce <head>activated</head> forms of oxygen , known as free radicals . These can damage DNA .

This has been an important influence in promoting a communicative approach to the teaching of languages .  It should be noted ,  however ,  that the rationale for such an approach relates primarily to the ends and not the means of learning ,  and is directed at furthering the cause of cultural co - operation in Europe .  The original concern for out - of - school education is evident in the way objectives are defined in terms of utility . : threshold level specifications are drawn up with an eye to meeting the needs of learners as eventual participants in contexts of communicative interaction , rather than with a concern to <head>activate</head> the actual learning process itself . Their relevance outside the situation for which they were designed ,  where eventual aims  cannot be so readily related to learning objectives ,  should not therefore be taken on trust  ( see Widdowson 1983 )  .  But it has been commonly supposed that specifications along threshold level lines must be universally relevant ,  without reference to the definition of objectives for learning on which the original threshold level specifications are based.

It will be clear that on any particular occasion of meaning negotiation the more familiar the schematic content or mode of communication ,  the less reliance needs to be placed on systemic knowledge ,  and vice versa .  If ,  for example ,  I am engaged in reading a text on a subject in which I am well versed  ( where the ideational or content schema is familiar )  ,  which has been written in a manner conventionally associated with writing on this subject  ( where the interpersonal or formal schema is familiar )  ,  then I shall only need to pay attention to the linguistic signs to the extent that they key in this schematic knowledge and indicate how it is to be extended .  Many of the specific meanings which can be deciphered out of the symbol are not <head>activated</head> because they are not indexically required . This ,  of course ,  relates to the point made by Johnson - Laird earlier :  that an effective  ( i.e. indexical )  use of language does not depend on knowing precise  ( i.e. symbolically complete )  meanings .  On the other hand ,  if I encounter a text which deals with an unfamiliar content area and does so in accordance .  with communicative or rhetorical conventions which are new to me ,  then I obviously have to look much more closely at the language itself as a source of information as to what might be meant .

The question that  then needed to be answered was whether the dd  fusion was being induced by collisions within the hot plasma  thermonuclear fusion  or from some other non - thermonuclear processes such as collisions between deuterons that had been accelerated to high energies during the initial pulse of current and other deuterons of comparatively low energies .

Indeed ,  their emotional behaviour was often exaggerated .  Papez therefore located the emotional behaviour mechanisms in the brainstem ,  especially in the mammillary bodies which ,  he believed ,  received sensory information via subcortical relay routes ,  and cognitive information from the cerebral cortex via the hippocampus and its subcortical projection system ,  the fornix .  Emotional experience , on the other hand , he thought was the result of <head>activating</head> specific areas of the cerebral cortex in much the same way as activating other areas produced visual or auditory experience . On the basis of some remarkably weak clinical evidence he decided that the site of emotional experience was the cingulate gyrus ,  which lies on the medial surface of the hemispheres .  All of the areas that Papez implicated in emotion are part of an anatomically identified system known  as the limbic system .

This is most clearly seen in studies of the primate visual cortex  ( Maunsell and Newsome 1987 )  .  Visual field representations are mapped by sampling successive locations in the visual cortex with a microelectrode and ,  at each location ,  determining where you have to place a stimulus in the visual field to activate single cells at that location .  You find that cells in adjacent parts of the visual cortex are <head>activated</head> by stimulation in adjacent parts of the visual field . The cortex is said to be retinotopically mapped .

Using peptide sequence information derived from purified bovine glial growth factors ,  we have isolated several clones that encode Schwann cell mitogenic activities .  The group of proteins encoded by these transcripts includes the three described glial growth factors  ( ref .  22 ,  and A.D.J.G .  et al. ,   manuscript submitted )  and several proteins  ( heregulins and Neu differentiation factor )  that have various activities on cultured breast tumour cells .  The heregulins and NDF are specific activators of the p185 erbB2 receptor and rhGGF - II <head>activates</head> the phosphorylation of a Schwann cell protein that is similar in size to p185 erbB2 . Based on several lines of evidence ,  including the data presented here ,  we suggest that various p185 erbB2  ligands ,  such as the GGFs ,  are important in development ,  regeneration and tumour formation in the nervous system .  A critical stage in the development of the peripheral nervous system is the projection of axons to their targets ,  the ensheathment of these axons and their subsequent myelination by Schwann cells .

A purse - string mechanism based on a contractile cable fits the observations of others who have investigated embryonic wound healing and seen similar patterns of epidermal movement .  But it does not apply to minute epidermal lesions that leave the basal lamina intact ,  or to embryonic epidermal cells moving on a rigid adhesive substratum in culture :  here the conventional mechanism of epidermal crawling seems to operate .  Two central questions arise : what initiates the formation of the actin cable , and what <head>activates</head> its contraction and the associated cell rearrangements ? The experiments of Kolega are illuminating here .  Stress applied to a migrating epidermal cell at right angles to its direction of movement  ( tangential to the leading edge of its lamellipodium )  causes the lamellipodium to retract and brings about a reorganization of the cell 's  actin into a cable oriented along the major axis of stress .

No effects on limb growth are observed when unrelated growth factors  ( platelet - derived growth factor ,  epidermal growth factor ,  insulin )  or retinoic acid are added to the culture medium ,  or in control cultures  ( Table 1 )  .

The properties of cooperativity ,  associativity and input - specificity can now easily be explained .  The cooperativity threshold follows from the need for depolarization to reduce the level of the Mg 2+  block of the NMDA channel .  Weak stimuli , activating only a few fibres , fail to induce LTP not because insufficient L - glutamate is released to <head>activate</head> NMDA receptors , but because the level of depolarization provided by the weak input does not produce an adequate reduction of the Mg 2+ block . When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,  depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,  these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization ,  and ,  experimentally ,  depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .

But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged ,  and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit ,  including K - 252b  ( ref .  85 )  ,  are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .  There is also disagreement as to whether the sustained kinase activity that might be necessary for LTP is located within the postsynaptic cell or not. A recent view is that a postsynaptic kinase is <head>activated</head> transiently ( for less than a few minutes following the tetanus ) and a presynaptic kinase is activated for longer periods ( but for less than 1 hour ) . These kinases might be the   and   isoforms of PKC ,  respectively .  Intracellular injection of the catalytic subunit of PKC induces synaptic potentiation as does the extracellular application of activators of PKC ,  such as certain phorbol esters .

This receptor corresponds to the cloned family GluR14 47  .  When the Schaffer collateral - commissural pathway is stimulated it also <head>activates</head> GABAergic interneurons ( through glutamatergic synapses similar to those on pyramidal neurons ) and this leads to the biphasic i.p.s.p . which curtails the e.p.s.p .

NMDA receptors contribute little to the synaptic response because of their relatively slow activation kinetics .

A fresh and exciting talent a brilliant beginning ,  commented the anonymous reviewer in the Queen 's  Quarterly  .  All of this he offered in a variety of poetic forms ,  from the traditional quatrain to the more controversial prose - poem Friends .

For such ,  God only frowns on the world ,  and stirs it to judgment ;  the butterfly cannot break loose into flight ;  it merely expires ,  as Leonard expressed it ,  ending its life in three flag - swept days.

The BeSHT became so influential that the leaders of the people ,  the power - manipulators and self - appointed guardians of the Law ,  had no alternative but to do what their like has always done to those who broke loose ,  butterfly - like :  They excommunicated him ;  marginalised his usefulness ;  neutered his religious potency :  A prophet is not without honour Now one of the interesting cameos of God 's  providence ,  prominently found in the Talmud and among the Hasidim ,  is the idea that in every generation are 36 tsadihim  ,  pious or righteous men ,  who  ( though unknown )  keep the world going .

It is also advisable to take a vitamin B supplement to aid in the digestion of the carbohydrate .  Once the carbohydrate has been consumed it is stored as glycogen in the muscles and stays there until it is required for energy .  This storage of glycogen in the muscles <head>adds</head> to the overall size of the muscles . Once training is underway the glycogen is gradually removed from the muscles to produce energy and is replaced by blood ,  that is the muscles are pumped .  After training has finished the blood supply is reduced and the pump disappears ,  resulting in the muscle being smaller than before the exercise started .

In mainland Europe the spacing between tracks and reversible signalling enables engineers to work on one track in complete safety while traffic continues to pass on the other. Here the engineers have to carry out most of their work on Sundays when traffic is light ,  but this often entails diversions and extended journey times followed by temporary speed restrictions for a few further days at the beginning of each week .  To compensate for these temporary speed restrictions additional recovery time is <head>added</head> to daytime schedules . Following studies by Eastern Region 's  engineers ,  a new tracklaying strategy was introduced in 1987 whereby  with the use of a new machine called the Dynamic Track Stabiliser  tracks could be handed back by 06.00 on Monday morning at the full 125mph line speed ,  eliminating the need for a temporary speed restriction and associated recovery time allowance .  Removal of these recovery allowances made possible a general acceleration of East Coast 125mph services from May 1987 .

There is a major difference between real ale and keg beer .  Keg ,  which includes lager ,  is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to <head>add</head> a full , mature palate , keg beers are killed off in the brewery by filtration , chilling and pasteurisation . The aim is to produce beers that are sterile ,  have a long shelf life and are highly profitable .  In the case of keg milds and bitters when fermentation is complete they are conditioned for a short period under gas pressure and are then filtered to remove yeast solids and pasteurised .

When the hopped wort has been cooled it is run to fermenting vessels where it meets its destiny with yeast .  The type of yeast strain used for ale is known as top fermenting .  It works at a warm temperature and vigorously turns the sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide , producing at the same time ripe fruity aromas that <head>add</head> to the pleasure of ale drinking . The great head of yeast created during fermentation is cropped off and after a week the remaining yeast is overcome by the alcohol it has produced and sinks to the bottom of the fermenter .  The liquid is now officially called beer but it needs a few days further conditioning in the brewery ,  to purge some of the rough alcohols ,  before it is ready to leave for the pub .

It is in the pub cellar that the beers  reaches  maturity .

Unfortunately releasing these into the wort requires mutually  incompatable  conditions .  Flavours rapidly evaporate from hot wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop .  Brewers have been aware of this issue for centuries and have developed the practice of <head>adding</head> copper hops early in the boil to provide bitterness and aroma or late hops towards the end of the boil for flavour . While whole hops are repeatedly claimed to produce the best hop character in a beer ,  problems may be encountered .  First is the liability of hops to deterioration by oxygen in the air .

He <head>added</head> : No real crime was alleged in the libel . It was not in a national newspaper .  It was not a front page spread .

According to this American guide ,  Art criticism is a many - levelled activity that comprises the historical ,  the recreative ,  and the judicial .  In all cases it seeks to pronounce value judgements ,  an exercise shunned by art history .  The signs are that the next few years will see some extensive soul - searching about art history ; several books have already <head>appeared</head> . From Germany there is The End of the History of Art  ;  from Britain a group of essays describe The New Art History  ;  from the United States has recently come Rethinking Art History :  meditations on a coy science  ;  and from Canada there is a forthright title Art History :  its use and abuse  .  Art criticism seems more likely to remain in the shadows ,  out of the spotlight of academic controversy .

Art histories often make an attempt to keep to chronology ,  although the difficulties include the crucial fact that in art there is no clear sequence of events .  Unlike old - fashioned narrative history ,  art has no decisive battles ,  no international treaties ,  and no changes of government .  This is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight <head>appear</head> . Newer approaches to history can give accounts which do not have landmark events and which tell us about different aspects of the past ,  such as social conditions .  Deciding where is the beginning can be a trouble for an art historian .

The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used .  In the late twentieth century artists working in performance pose difficulties for the critic ,  though some observers find it refreshing rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture .  In sum , then , the monograph is a major site for art critical writing , and , moreover , the place where the most extended criticism is likely to <head>appear</head> . The reader may be disappointed by the standard of what is written ,  but unlike other sites of criticism ,  this cannot be attributed to the form of publication ,  only to the limitations of the author .  In a monograph ,  the author has the best chance of a free hand .

It is also through observation that fakes are unmasked .

Tom Wolfe 's book The Painted Word is a witty example of the genre ; it originally <head>appeared</head> in Harper 's Magazine , before being made into a book in 1975 . There are good satirical illustrations by the author ,  paralleled by a text which makes fun of American criticism ,  Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art .  Wolfe puts his argument as follows :  What I saw before me was the critic - in - chief of the New York Times  saying :  In looking at a painting today ,  to lack a persuasive theory is to lack something crucial .

Yet such a comment may need to be made ,  nevertheless ,  to point out the quality of a picture .  The critic who pays little notice to perspective or other means of representing the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoying the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of Impressionist pictures ,  whose qualities are inspired by scientific understanding of light and its effects .  In a different sort of context , what <head>appears</head> to be an abstract design , devoid of reference to the natural world , may in fact be a stylisation of a person , an animal or an imagined figure . The totems of American Indians ,  the carvings of Inouk ,  ancient bronze ritual vessels from China ,  and many more examples can be found through the world and the centuries .  Most African sculpture is not in this category ,  as characteristically the masks and ritual objects of Africa are more evidently human or animal in appearance .

The article leads you to wonder about her religious faith ,  if she has one ,  and about where it stands in relation to the outlook of the editor of Commentary  ,  author of a book about his ambitions for worldly success :  Making it  must be the least pious book that has ever been written .  The stress on Levi 's  insensitivity to religion is allowed to suggest that all Jews are religious ,  and there are readers for whom this might signal the corollary that all Jews are Zionists ,  and are likely to be supporters of Israeli government policy .  By these standards , Levi would <head>appear</head> to be an imperfect Jew , and this could well be an opinion that underlies the talk about his later books being not nearly as good as his earlier ones .

THE DOMINANT BELIEFS OF THE TWO ALLIANCES As we examine the dominant beliefs of the two alliances ,  it must be stressed that we are not looking at beliefs possessed by each and every person who identifies to a greater or lesser extent with either set of traditions .  Rather we are looking at those beliefs , supported by significant power bases within each bloc , which have won out in the political process in the past seventy years and still <head>appear</head> to be doing so , in some cases with much decreased vitality . The dominant beliefs of the catholic  nationalist bloc still are that the group forms a people who are Gaelic - Irish ,  constitute a nation ,  are republican ,  and populate an island which has a natural ,  inner political unity .  We reiterate :  the dominant beliefs of the alliances which we have termed historical blocs are not necessarily shared by all but are promoted successfully by dominant groups and have some grounding in the consciousness of the wider membership .

Indeed ,  until the ecumenical era of the 1960s ,  few catholics in Ireland were prepared to put before themselves some of the political religious issues which would have to be resolved if a united Ireland or accommodation to a separate political entity in Ulster were to become a possibility .  The other alliance in Ireland ,  the protestant  loyalist ,  does not thus far perceive itself as a nation .  The view that they are one <head>appears</head> mainly in the writings of the British and Irish Communist Organization ( 1972 ; 1973 ) . However ,  there can be little doubt that significant numbers of protestant loyalists see themselves as a distinct ,  almost ethnic group .  Clearly ,  they can be seen to have a particular self - concept ,  a sense of what Weber termed social honour  ( Wallis ,  Bruce ,  and Taylor 1986 )  .

In fairness to de Valera ,  it must be said that he opposed any attempt to incorporate the church into the apparatus of the state and in this was ,  as already noted ,  going against the form of relationship preferred by the Popes of the day .

But that did not mean that the ethos of a Roman catholic state would be in any way diminished ,  only that the form of political religious power would be different .

The Roman catholic bishops supported the wording of the referendum and ,  as the referendum approached ,  said it was legitimate to oppose the amendment even if one was against abortion ,  which was in any case still immoral and was the direct taking of an innocent life  ( Irish Bishops '  Conference statement ,  quoted O'Carroll 1983 )  .  However ,  on the eve of the referendum ,  the majority of priests preached against abortion .  The nexus <head>appears</head> to have been made for a sufficient number of the laity , as those who eventually voted in the referendum voted in favour of inscribing an appropriate anti - abortion clause in the constitution . Article 40 ,  paragraph 3 ,  section 3 ,  now reads :  The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and ,  with due regard to the equal right of life of the mother ,  guarantees in its laws to respect ,  and ,  as far as practicable ,  by its laws ,  defend and vindicate that right .

He also continued to affirm that the introduction of divorce would make it more difficult for people to lead good moral lives .  Divorce has this effect because it suggests that remarriage in the lifetime of one 's  first partner is socially and even morally acceptable '  (  Irish Times  ,  6 June 1986 ;  also 31 May 1986 ;  14 June 1986 )  .  This same interpretation <head>appeared</head> in the Irish bishops ' next statement in mid - June. Voters had to decide in conscience whether other factors outweigh the damage which divorce would certainly cause to individuals ,  to families ,  to children and to the whole of society  (  Irish Times  ,  13 June 1986 )  .  The bishops claimed ,  however ,  they were making it clear that people could in conscience vote for the introduction of divorce without incurring moral blame provided they made the decision in a reflective and conscientious way .

Professor Dudek had envisaged the series coming out in paper covers  ( the format that was just becoming the  way  to the mass market )  ;  Leonard ensured that it went into hard ;  Dudek had not meant the books to be prestigious in format but vehicles of introduction ;  Leonard saw to it that his book could stand alongside the best that there were from both sides of the Atlantic .  And he himself covered the entire costs  ( of 300 )  ,  and did most of the distribution and selling  ( on the campus ,  in the local cafs ,  in bookstores and so on ,  aided by a mini - advertising campaign in the McGill paper )  .

The fact that we often feel that our thoughts come unheralded by intentions ,  that the content of our mental life is unwilled ,  just demonstrates how thin is the layer of consciousness .  This is a familiar point to those who know anything of Freudian theory .  But there is , perhaps , one crucial objection to the constructivist 's claim that moving the focus away from mental representations and towards mental actions will make the mind - body problem <head>appear</head> to us as less of a problem . It is this :  saying that the character of mental representations  ( beliefs and imaginings ,  for example )  can be understood only in terms of a history of activity ,  or that it is the subject 's  conception of himself as active in relation to the world which gives these representations their content or semantics  ( I hope to have shown something like this )  is simply irrelevant  to the mind - body problem .  This is the problem of how mentality  call it mental representations or cognisant acts  relates to its physical realization in the brain .

This is probably the most untrue statement I have heard in some time .  Steffi Graf never makes excuses ,  never  its her most famous trademark after her forehand !  It would <head>appear</head> otherwise , at times , due to wording of newspaper articles . The press apparently had expected Steffi 's  invincible reign to last for several years  when last year Graf had a bad year  ( by her standards )  the men and women of the press understandably searched for reasons for it  and voiced them .  They were mostly sympathising with her loss of form and her problems .

This is what must happen when a ballet ends happily .  Three fine examples of this exhilaration can be found in the excited circling of the cast round the hero and heroine in such ballets as Copplia ,  Pineapple Poll  and Daphnis and Chlo  .  Choreographers however should avoid what can be called a purely technical analysis of the music by matching particular patterns of steps to particular musical phrases whenever they <head>appear</head> . This is what Balanchine has frequently done .  It was first noted in Ballet Imperial   ( 1941 )  when every time a scale - like passage in the second movement of Tchaikovsky 's  Piano Concerto No. 2 is played ,  the three soloists link hands to make two arches through which the corps de ballet  ran round the houses  ( Edwin Evans )  .

It should be noted that a similar order of precedence exists in Ashton 's  Scnes de Ballet  as in Petipa 's  The Sleeping Beauty  which was supposed to be an evocation of a court ballet at the time of Louis XIV .  However ,  when ballets were performed for the public ,  professional dancers took the place of courtiers and technical innovations had to be made .  The dancers now <head>appeared</head> on a stage before a wide audience and the focus of their attention changed to the whole audience or to the most important performers .

He further developed what he called his danced mime or mimed dance in The Firebird  and above all in Petrushka  .  It is in this field that Ashton and MacMillan have made many innovations in those of their ballets that describe very subtle relationships ,  feelings and emotions such as A Month in the Country  and Enigma Variations ,  The  Invitation  and Mayerling  .  In the last , MacMillan 's choreography makes Bratfisch , the prince 's coachman , <head>appear</head> as the only sympathetic yet helpless onlooker at the sordid proceedings .

Ashton did the same when Daphnis competed for Chlo 's  attention in his interpretation of Ravel 's  Daphnis and Chlo  .  When the character of Harlequin ,  the Comic Lover ,  had become familiar in England he was quickly promoted to lead the pantomimes ;  nowhere in ballet does he rise to more commanding heights than as Captain Belaye in Cranko ,  s Pineapple Poll  ,  where he takes on the superior airs and manners of the British Navy and becomes the apple of every girl 's  eye .  Columbine too started life as a servant of the gods and gradually rose in rank from waiting on the aristocracy to conspiring with Harlequin in such ballets as The Good - Humoured Ladies , where the two of them <head>appear</head> as serving maid and waiter . Columbine became Mother Simone 's  daughter ,  Lise ,  in La Fille Mal Garde  where she makes butter ,  churns and helps to spin .

Ashton 's  re - working of the old story of Ondine   ( with music by Hans Werner Henze )  was a perfect modern version of the older type of romantic ballet .  He not only used very expressive ports de bras  for his other - worldly characters but changed the usual conception of classical pointe - work .  Ondine , the sea nymph ( Margot Fonteyn ) so used her feet that she <head>appeared</head> always to float through water . This was done by a series of pas marchs  each of which softly rose and fell through her feet from toe to heel .  They were co - ordinated with a soft undulating movement of the arms .

Success will depend very largely on the dancer 's  own sense of timing and ability so to perform the gestures created that they convey meaning which makes sense within the context of the ballet .  This can be done only if the whole body is seen to be involved in some way or other. It also depends on how the gesture is extended in time and space so that it <head>appears</head> to emanate from the dancer 's concentration on the purpose of the gesture . Amongst the greatest dancer - mimes even the slightest wink  becomes obvious .  De Valois ,  Ashton and MacMillan have studied paintings and drawings by English artists and/or the words of such great playwrights as Shakespeare and translated them into gestures for which the dancer 's  whole body has to play a part .

These choreographers must create movements which display each protagonist 's  particular behaviour and reactions .  Too often their movements are insufficiently defined because too much effort is made to shock ,  unlike the tightly controlled movements of characters in The Rake 's  Progress  and A Distant Drummer  .  In each of the three ballets discussed movements are not merely coloured by natural emotional expression but often by conventional and occupational gesture , which <head>appear</head> to spring from each dancer 's physical and mental reactions to each situation as it arises . A comparison of such different ballets as Enigma Variations ,  Fancy Free  and The  Rake 's  Progress  emphasises how important it is for young choreographers to remember that ballet is an art of the general as well as of the particular .  This arises from the fact that no one really dances through life ,  though doing so once the curtain has risen .

Also ,  and perhaps to a greater extent ,  a man is what he has  smelt :  later in the novel Raskolnikov gives the police - station smell as the reason for the suspicious circumstance of his fainting ,  which is neither the whole truth nor a straight lie but the blending of the guilty man with the Poison of the city .  Crime and Punishment 's Petersburg does not produce the murderer with the inevitability shown by the abstract city in the novel immediately preceding it , where the underground man was bound to <head>appear</head> in our midst .

Furthermore ,  At Tikhon 's  provides the chance to get a look at the figure named by me Dostoevsky 's  good angel ,  because here again ,  as in the two earlier cases ,  the novelist took no steps to restore the deleted material at some future date when he was his own master ;  and I think he was right .  My Proposition ,  embracing The House of the Dead ,  Notes from Underground ,  Crime and Punishment ,  The Possessed ,  Karamazov  ,  and ,  negatively ,  by way of relative failure ,  The Idiot  ,  is that Dostoevsky could only promote his dearest values by creeping up on their blind side :  in other words that he had an urge towards crisis and clarity which he could only satisfy by yielding it to the enemy  to the horror of the flogging routine in the Thy kingdom come episode in the Dead House at one chronological extreme ,  and to Ivan Karamazov 's  showdown with the Religion Swindle at the other. Clarity <head>appears</head> in those self - directed exhortations of the novelist to elucidate Raskolnikov 's motive for murder . The novel itself ignores them .

It is arguable that the disappearance of grammar schools was a further factor in the weakening of the English synthesis ,  in addition to those I have discussed .

It was a collection of essays designed to introduce la nouvelle critique  to ignorant English readers :  apart from the editors ,  the contributors included Julia Kristeva and Philippe Sollers ,  and there was an interview with Roland Barthes .

Despite what brewers '  architects often allege ,  the life expectancy of such plastic window units is proving remarkably short  as little as five years for the fittings ,  and twenty years for the plastic itself ,  which is exhibiting distinct tendencies to warp and discolour with age .

( Tye does compare this learning to learning to balance a pencil on your nose ,  but if that comparison is made to do any work ,  Tye 's  theory will simply be a behaviouristic one ,  and he usually seems to want it to be more than this .  )  Tye , however , does have an <head>argument</head> for his conclusion that what is extra is not really something extra . I think the argument is that if we call the nature of the experience R ,  and if we concede the materialist claim that R is a brain state ,  then in knowing the brain state the blind scientist knows R ,  though not what R is like .  Because BS knows all the facts about the brain state ,  and the experience just is  the brain state ,  then what the experience is like  must be something other than a fact about the experience .

The <head>argument</head> transposes , however . Since merely knowing the brain state does not reveal what the experience is like ,  and since what the experience is like  ,  if it is a reality at all  ( which Tye does not dispute )  ,  must be a fact about the experience  ( or a feature or aspect of the experience ,  which will do just as well )  ,  it follows that the experience is not a brain state .  There is one well - known materialist account of different modes of knowledge that might seem to be useful here in preserving the  mode of knowledge approach against the need for the more drastic behaviouristic alternative .

So perhaps my overkill misses the target :  perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound ,  even though a general behaviourism is not ,  and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states ,  but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli ,  that is ,  to respond as a result of actually seeing them .  Reflection on the nature of the argument against behaviourism in general ,  however ,  reveals that the argument refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular .  That <head>argument</head> showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions , for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world . But there is nowhere else that we might get our conception of the physical world from ,  other than perception .  It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .

This predicament arises out of the demise of consciousness ,  when only consciousness ,  understood in a traditional way ,  can bring us face to face with ,  and hence give us any grasp on ,  the qualitative ,  as opposed to relational ,  properties .  So the flight from consciousness is the flight from any grasp on the intrinsic nature of any properties  not merely ,  as with Russell ,  of properties in the external world ,  but also of the features in our experience .  This is not merely a very bare conception of the world , but <head>argument</head> supports intuition in pronouncing it an incoherent one . It reduces language to an uninterpreted formal system .  All we know about As ,  for example ,  is that they have relation to R to Bs ,  relation R ' to Cs ,  relation R '  to Ds ,  etc ;  and similarly for our understanding of Bs ,  Cs and Ds ,  and the variety of Rs .

And so ,  as in Winter Notes  ,  Dostoevsky is really talking about pochvennost  ,  his own brand of romantic conservatism ,  half history ,  half dream .  In Crime and Punishment  itself the Petrine reforms get the merest glancing reference ,  and only one ,  when Raskolnikov 's  friend Razumikhin speaks of us  ( compare the we of the Drunks  fragment )  as divorced from practical affairs of every sort for nearly two hundred years .  This is a hasty throw - off in the middle of a wide - ranging <head>argument</head> , and it has no particular bearing on drink . Nor for that matter on crime .

We all limp ,  more or less ,  was the antihero 's  way of putting it ,  and for him all consciousness was a disease .  His own hyperconsciousness ,  the disease in an acute form ,  he considered a product of nineteenth - century civilization ,  rendered yet more virulent by the abstract and intentional city he lived in .  This tight <head>argument</head> becomes relaxed and humanized in Crime and Punishment . The hyperconscious Double Act in which Svidrigailov 's  terminal boredom plays opposite the greedy ,  theoretical self - assertion of Raskolnikov 's  wanting something more than mere existence ,  becomes grounded in suicide and murder ;  and the Petersburg where these things happen gains a fuzzy - edged documentary aspect which never comes anywhere near dominating the novel ,  but which is there .

He recognizes the mythology of its English adherents ,  in which all criticism of their ideas attracts the charge of a characteristically insular suspicion of nasty foreign ideas ,  but he is prepared to risk it ,  continuing :  Those who feel hostile to much recent literary theory but are unwilling or unable to formulate their objections often lazily dismiss it as merely another Parisian fashion ,  citing the rapid displacement or structuralism by poststructuralism as evidence that the writings or Barthes ,  Derrida ,  Lacan and their American epigones constitute a craze rather than a serious intellectual movement .  There may be some justification for the ( insular ) suspicion that when the Emperor is restocking his wardrobe he usually shops in Paris ; but the rashionability or ideas does not or itself constitute an honest <head>argument</head> against them ; indeed , to offer this as one 's main response is to betray intellectual bankruptcy . It is less easy ,  but more interesting ,  to try to understand why  ancient radical doubts about the ability or language to express a genuine extra - linguistic reality have been revived in recent decades to the point where they seem to have achieved an almost popular appeal .  Tallis sets himself the task of showing that much of the structuralist and poststructuralist enterprise is based on a misreading of Saussure .

In Bowie 's  words ,  Future sociologists of knowledge will no doubt study the mechanisms whereby an enfeebled Lacanism ' has come to loom larger within the intellectual life of a society than the original  ideas and texts .  In England ,  Lacanian ideas have been linked with Marxist ones ,  as in MacCabe 's  James Joyce and the Revolution of the Word  ;  Catherine Belsey 's  Critical Practice  ,  which identified Lacan 's  symbolic order of language ,  into which the infant enters ,  with the Althusserian realm of ideology ;  and Anthony Easthope 's  Poetry as Discourse  which related Lacan 's  dissolution of the ego to New Critical impersonality and structuralist dropping of the author .  One would have thought that Marxism and Lacanism would inhabit wholly disparate worlds of thought ; the former is rationalistic and teleological , whereas for Lacan , as Bowie says , <head>arguments</head> directed towards a terminus are falsehoods . Yet there are affinities ,  as Frederick Crews points out :  In Althusser 's  and Lacan 's  hands ,  then ,  both Marxism and psychoanalysis exchange an adaptive materialism for allegory .

Leavisism assumed that its rewriting of the canon had a once - and - for - all quality ,  so that it was inconceivable that anyone could come to admire Shelley again ,  though this is precisely what has happened under the influence of Harold Bloom ,  who is dedicated to overturning the Eliot - Leavis version of poetic history .  The attempt to enforce an evaluative criticism in the academy inevitably results in rigidity and dogmatism and ,  ultimately ,  a form of brainwashing .  Leavisites , of course , claimed that they were committed to discussion , argument , the free play of mind ; in so far as they were , it was contained within the enclosing form of life , not directed against it , rather like <head>arguments</head> within Marxist - Leninist ideology . It was this aspect of Leavisism that Oxford English ,  with its broad though often flaccid eclecticism ,  was most opposed to .  Venturing to propound a law of intellectual life ,  I suggest that evaluative criticism enters institutional literary study under the influence of practising writers ,  or of critics who have a close discipular relation to them ,  but that in time it is rejected ,  like an alien organ .

Mr Lightman claimed that if the jury which had awarded the 600,000 had known that Mrs Sutcliffe was not adverse to taking money for her story ,  the outcome could have been different .  He said evidence of private conversations between journalists of Associated Newspapers about the secret deal ,  and of Mrs Sutcliffe 's  deliberate concealment of The Mail on Sunday 's  actions ,  could throw completely new light on the case .

Improvements in the handling of appeals The year had seen two separate and different initiatives .  The first was announced in a Practice Direction  ( 1989 )  1 WLR 281 ,  which provided for the much earlier delivery of skeleton arguments which would be studied by the judges before they sat to hear the appeal .  The primary purpose was to reduce the costly time spent on oral <head>argument</head> in so far as that was not necessary for the proper determination fo the appeal . It was too early to reach firm conclusions as to the direction 's  effectiveness .

Whether it can now or should be applied to the Cairngorms is open to <head>argument</head> . The book is divided into three parts .  Crumley starts by analysing the piecemeal approach to development and lack of adequate environmental control in the Cairngorms .

Her relations with both her Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer became somewhat cool ,  not least because she attempted to run both foreign and financial policy herself .  The dangers to the Thatcher regime ,  it appeared ,  came not from revolts or putsches  on the back benches .

Still less did the danger lie in overthrow by Labour or by assorted dissidents or intellectuals .  It lay rather in its rigidity ,  in the way that centralization was hardening ,  some felt ,  into something approaching personal dictatorship .

The worms in Lucretius explanation of inflation works as follows :  a trade union ,  because of its bargaining strength with monopoly powers ,  secures an increase in the remuneration of its members ,  say ,  5 ,  10 ,  15 per cent  what they call excessive or unjustified .  Then ,  says the theory ,  this naturally causes all the other wages and prices to go up too .  Now , the beauty of this sort of explanation , where you have everybody on your side , when you are dealing with somebody who is unpopular , when you are all desperately anxious to find a scapegoat , is that your <head>argument</head> is unlikely to be at all jealously scrutinised . As Professor Housman used to say ,  Stand on a barrel in the streets of Baghdad and say twice two are four and ginger is hot in the mouth and therefore Mohammed is the prophet of God ,  and it is unlikely that anyone would question your reasoning ;  but if he should be bold enough to do so ,  you could easily silence him by calling him a Christian dog .  So it is ,  say I in my simplistic fashion ,  that the plain ,  screaming absurdity of the statement that trade - union action causes a general rise in wages and prices escapes scrutiny .

In order to do this ,  however ,  Britain must herself become in some degree protectionist and place tariffs on foreign imports of at least the things which the Dominions had to sell to her  above all ,  food ,  if not also raw materials .

Yet the Imperial side of the <head>argument</head> whatever view may be taken of the fiscal , economic and domestic would not stand up to examination . If the Empire was to be welded into an economic unit ,  the parts of which would be interdependent economically because they were parts of the Empire ,  and if this unity was to stand in default or in anticipation of political unity ,  then what was necessary was Imperial free trade ,  a genuine Zollverein  .

This system of sessions lets certain producers develop young musicians '  talent ,  and there is a lengthy list of internationally famous rock and pop stars who were helped by a Radio 1 session .

The attribution or assumption of this identity marks the creation of the homosexual .  Alan Bray and Jeffrey Weeks have given historical support to this view ,  though not without qualification ;  I remarked in Part 1 some further reservations .  Additionally , we should recall that , before the nineteenth century , the meanings of terms like sodomy and buggery might have been even wider than is suggested by Foucault 's <head>argument</head> . Sodomy was associated with witches ,  demons ,  werewolves ,  basilisks ,  foreigners ,  and  ( of course )  papists ;  and it apparently signified a wide range of practices including prostitution ,  under - age sex ,  coitus interruptus ,  and female transvestism .  Socially ,  sodomy was repeatedly equated with heresy and political treason ;  metaphysically ,  it was conceived as sexual contusion in whatever form ,  a force of anarchic disorder set against divine Creation ,  not a part of the created order but an aspect of its dissolution .

Compared to these two cultural moments ,  even the political revolutions and great wars in modern European history are ,  I would venture ,  of the surface  (  Real Presences  ,  101 ,  94  6 )  .  Steiner and Sontag are in a sense correct about the centrality of homosexuality to modern culture .  But the <head>argument</head> of this book is that its centrality is quite otherwise than they suggest . Steiner 's  ludicrous generalizations stem in part from the very notion of defining cultures and history in terms of a sensibility .  Even a cursory look at gay history and culture suggests that the sweep and conclusions of his argument are questionable at virtually every turn ,  as indeed is the very notion of a homosexual sensibility .

Indeed ,  if the story enacted in a picture is not known ,  quite wrong inferences can be drawn from what is perceived .

If the philosophical discontinuity Foucault describes is truly occurring ,  then an inside or reflexive exploration of police practice should reveal the strength of these divisive classificatory techniques ,  for any binary separation of man by his contemporaries into the non - human categories suggested by Leach  ( 1982 )  is the very stuff of anthropology .  And if such a classificatory system is a major feature of the way the police control their fellow citizens ,  then it seems essential it should be identified ,  assessed ,  and described .  Foucault ( 1980 ) , like Thompson ( 1980 ) , asserts that the criminal justice system is increasingly becoming an <head>arm</head> of the state apparatus , with the institution of policing beginning to wield expanding socio - political power . In a liberal democracy this needs to be scrutinized constantly ,  and herein lies the first problem for the researcher .  For how can one really study a system of state control without acknowledging that such an activity itself is antithetical to  the direction of power ?

Obviously ,  you cannot rely on a hard landing in the case of face punches ,  so other means must be employed .  Even in the case of front <head>arm</head> jabs , the distance travelled should be maximised and the action demonstrated as a thrust rather than a snap . Many valid front punches are not scored because they travel such short distances at high speed ,  and are  snapped back before the panel can react .  A thrusting action should accompany all linear punches and kicks ,  since it is believed to be related to potential power in a way that a snapping action is not.

( Weights can be attached to the waist to make the dips much harder .  )  The use of cables ,  if available ,  is excellent for bringing out the definition at the centre of the chest  ( origin )  due to the fact that they allow movement over the body 's  centre - line without loss of tension .  Pectoral decks emphasise the outer part of the pecs near the insertion into the humerus ( upper <head>arm</head> ) . They also relieve stress on the elbows .  If women fully develop the lower pec muscles ,  the result is that the bust is pushed out by large underlying muscles ,  thus seeming larger .

Fig. 6 Back muscles The lateral and posterior heads should always be trained with specific exercises .  The best exercise for the lateral deltoid is dumb - bell side - lateral raises ( remember to only raise the <head>arms</head> to the horizontal because after this the upper trapezius will be used ) , The posterior deltoid is the least enjoyable to train , but should never be missed out . This head is worked hard by bent - over dumb - bell laterals or bent - over cable laterals if a cable cross - over machine is available .  It is unlikely that you will need to train the anterior deltoid specifically ,  but if you do then the straight arm dumb - bell raises to the front are excellent .

Therefore in daily training it is customary for each exercise to be performed to the left and right ,  forwards and backwards .  But even if a choreographer breaks such regularity when setting a classical ballet he usually balances the pattern made on the floor in one enchanement  by another moving in the opposite direction .  This balancing of floor patterns is also matched by the rise and fall of the dancers ' bodies , heads and <head>arms</head> . It is very noticeable in Petipa 's  ballets ,  particularly in all the corps de ballet  work of The Sleeping Beauty  .  Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .

In his Scottish dances Bournonville highlighted the Highland characteristic of an upwards lift from the floor on the first beat of a bar whereas in English and French dance the movement is downwards .  This makes the Scottish footwork look very light and easy particularly as it is allied to the steps of petit  and grand allegro  he also used .  Another important feature is the absolute co - ordination of the <head>arms</head> as they change in the ports de bras , often moving through the 1st position . The change usually occurs on the first beat of a bar or phrase ,  which eliminates any fussiness when the footwork is intricate .  Ashton maintained these formal changes in his frivolous Scottish Rhapsody .

If this is danced to 6/8 it leads to the very swift footwork needed fur Massine 's  tarantella and Ashton 's  version of the Italian pas de deux  in Swan Lake  ,  a miracle of timing and quick changes of auiement  .  This type of dancing to a dotted rhythm also leads to many steps where the dancers hop continuously on one leg holding the other firmly in attitude devant  ,  retire  ,  or stretched backwards .  Like Scottish ports de bras , those of Italy are very simple , the <head>arms</head> changing places after each sequence of dotted steps or hops . As traditional Italian dances are often sung ,  the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase .  This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .

He started by sketching numerous frescoes and statuettes he found in the Hermitage Museum ,  Leningrad .  From such ideas he formed dances which did away with pointes  but retained much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinated with the less familiar action of the arms and hands .  Thus the angular and straight lines drawn by the legs were also drawn simultaneously by the <head>arms</head> and hands , which were allowed to cross the centre line of the body , very often with a twist sideways at the waist . This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .  Something that David Bintley was also to achieve later in his Sons of Horus   ( 1985 )  .

This is shown vividly when ,  left finally alone ,  she strikes a dramatic pose of complete withdrawal from love and happiness .  Dorabella 's  playfulness is similar to that of Natalia 's  ward ,  Vera ,  when she first dances in A Month in the Country ,   .  The carefree quality disappears when she shyly tries to tell the Tutor how fond she has become of him , and when she discovers Natalia and the Tutor in each other 's <head>arms</head> , she loses all inhibitions to denounce them . Her shy confession of love is in deep contrast to that of Natalia ,  who cannot wait to show that her emotions are fully aroused when left alone with the same man. It is in these brief intimate scenes that Ashton exploits the difference between youth fulling in love and experience demanding it ,  because Natalia is used to getting her own way .

Emma Nicholson 's  Private Member 's  Bill against hackers ,  which failed to make the grade in the last session of Parliament ,  required anyone who entered a computer to his or anyone else 's  advantage ,  or to another 's  prejudice ,  to be charged with a serious offence ,  with a maximum penalty of 10 years .

Discretionary grants for further education have suffered in the climate of recent economic cuts and local government spending allowances can affect the number and level of grants awarded .  Generally ,  a local authority will aim to cover the full cost of fees and a living allowance although this can be subject to your personal circumstances and will vary depending on whether you will live with your parents during term time ,  or in rented accommodation .  It is possible that your local authority may <head>ask</head> you to audition for them after you have been offered a place . This seems an odd  way of going about things ,  but the advising panels do carry a professional adviser so that talent is not merely being judged by local civil servants .  The object of this rather clumsy piece of administration is to place some check on the expenditure of local money on the arts  and also to provide a further checkpoint on students who have already received educational grants for other careers .

In some schools you will be <head>asked</head> to participate with other students in basic class work over a weekend ( as happens at the Bristol Old Vic drama school ) and in some you may find yourself being judged partly by senior students of the school who will be sitting with the faculty panel ( which is something that happens at Drama Centre ) . The point of preparation is to be well tuned and at the same time flexible to new interpretations and ideas .  Rigidity of approach is something to be avoided at all costs  there is no point in being able to do a party piece one way and be unable to take in new direction on the same material .

Its early implementation met with a degree of resistance ,  for the new system fundamentally dislocates the well established and cultural preferences of the service .  Inspectors can no longer hide behind a paper managing a desk  ( quote from a Chief Superintendent )  .  Then again for reasons of established cultural preference we had to go back to the Audit Commission and <head>ask</head> them to translate 6.358 million into real men , for we had difficulty in trying to sell such an alien concept to the police mind . In effect their fiscal mandate meant their version of reality failed to synchronize with the police world view .  Constantly the symbolic or qualitative nature of police culture  slips through the grasp of the researcher or the audit analysis ,  simply because of its ephemeral potential for statistical assessment .

the implication of attempting to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officers about research findings ,  or collect ,  collate and distribute research of interest to the police service ,  and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable .

And surely ,  it can be argued ,  the understanding of what is to be ordered and who is to be disciplined has long been defined and subject to the practical mastery of the controllers .  In consequence ,  even when the insider retires and ostensibly leaves the family ,  he will be expected to maintain his silence ,  and although bland hagiographic biography has been acceptable in the past ,  there has been no place for the espionage of critical ethnography .

resulted in the controllers making a puritan attack directed at the drug taking of the  ( underground )  movement ;  and since the drug - scene is complex and confused ,  and we have little time in which to develop a reliable folk - lore about drugs and how to take them  ( as we have long ago done about alcohol )  ,  they have been particularly successful in fostering anxiety among teachers ,  parents and establishment figures .  Our part in this controlling puritan attack consisted of making the occasional arrest ,  while pursuing the unquantifiable social role which filled most of our time .  Furlong is correct , however , in suggesting that anxiety was rife , and because of this and establishment obsessions with a belief in a statistical truth we were constantly being <head>asked</head> to give numerical estimates of how many there were out there who were fixing , using the weed , or dropping acid . During the first three years of full - time drug squad work  ( 19668 )  arrests totalled some sixty - four persons  or less than two per month .  In this same period I saw many hundreds of users who never featured in the arrest tables and took many to hospital .

The actor is no different ,  although for some reason it is often thought that you are somehow ready to act ,  magically ,  the moment you enter a stage door .

Since 1980 professional training courses have proliferated and many can be found in and around London .

Throughout , the <head>atmosphere</head> is too casual , and in addition to a grave lack of frantic drivenness , there is a marked absence of the erotic .

A new - build scheme providing equivalent accommodation would be exempt from this tax .  Only if a building is listed can this significant premium on construction costs be avoided ,  although the majority of disused churches which are offered for conversion are of listed status .  The only note of criticism which can be sounded in relation to the admirable job of careful conversion which created much needed and characterful dwellings within the shell of a disused church at St James Court emerges from the preservation - conscious <head>atmosphere</head> of the present day . This mood might question the suitability of making the radical alterations to the aisle roof and the almost equally severe remodelling of the south slope of the nave roof which were implemented here  ( Plates 24 and 25 )  .  Although it is clear that these changes were made in order to admit light to the new ,  deep - plan living accommodation ,  it is conceivable that the judicious use of ranges of standard reversible and ventilating roof windows might have provided an answer to this requirement which would have been less erosive of the original external appearance .

The emphasis is on reflection .  In the new jazz climate ,  the anonymity of Peter King ,  one of the unsung great British saxophonists ,  has lifted a little  partly because one of his admirers is Ben Watt of Everything But The Girl ,  who is also the producer of Crusade .  Given that background , the album is unsurprisingly pop - influenced , with a velvety studio <head>atmosphere</head> , tunes by Smokey Robinson , Donny Hathaway and Joni Mitchell , even a funk version of Blue Monk . It all represents King a little too effectively marketed to tingle the skin ,  but underneath it all there is the same fluidity ,  the same lightning double - time runs ,  the same sense of shape ,  declaring that repackaging cannot really cramp his style .  The opposite extreme is represented by the Russian saxophonist ,  Vladimir Chekasin ,  sometime member of the Ganelin Trio ,  caught here live on the Munster Jazz Festival .

The congress taking place in an <head>atmosphere</head> of extreme vindictiveness among the SED rank and file following the corruption revelations will determine the future of the Communist Party. Representatives are due to elect a completely new central committee and politburo ,  but the party newspaper ,  Neues Deutschland ,  suggested yesterday that such Stalinist institutions would perhaps no longer be required if the SED was transformed into a truly democratic party .  The emergency SED leadership pledged that the congress would break with the Stalinist system .

BRITISH hopes of returning to normalcy in negotiations with China over the future of Hong Kong appeared to have been thwarted yesterday as the 14th round of Sino - British talks ended with only limited signs of progress .  Mr Anthony Galsworthy ,  the leader of the British Joint Liaison Group  ( JLG )  delegation ,  said that the four - day meeting certainly marks a return to business ,  but not necessarily as normal .  He added : It is no secret that the <head>atmosphere</head> in the past few months has not been easy . I would say that it is better in many respects than it was .  While British officials were busy trying to put the best face on the evident lack of progress at the talks ,  the Chinese delegation was eager to emphasise the differences between the sides .

NEXT time Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra perform Messiaen 's  Et Exspecto Resurrectionem Mortuorum they should do it in a great cathedral .  Not a modest one like St Asaph ,  where the gong and tam - tam crescendos of the third movement would be damagingly deafening ,  but in some vast Gothic building where the acoustic reverberations would be as effective as the spiritual associations in enhancing the effect of the piece .  In a place with an acoustic as dry and an <head>atmosphere</head> as worldly as Birmingham Town Hall it does n't work .

Heron shows in his article a deep sympathy with Braque 's  work ,  which ,  incidentally ,  was a sort of painting he himself was seeking to practise at the time .

Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .  Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the <head>audience</head> into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effectively ) .

Amongst the most important of these carefully plotted works are :  de Falla 's  The  Three - Cornered Hat   ( 1919 )  which originally accompanied a mime play and so fascinated Diaghilev that he commissioned the composer to enlarge it for Massine 's  ballet  ( see page 59 )  ;  Vaughan William 's  Job ,  commissioned by Diaghilev ,  was unused until de Valois created her important Masque for Dancing  ( 1931 )   ( this marked the inaugural performance of what has become The Royal Ballet )  ;  Arthur Bliss '  Checkmate   ( 1937 )  was choreographed by de Valois after both composer and choreographer had worked on the plot ;  Prokofiev 's  Romeo and Juliet  was composed with the help of a Shakespearean theatre expert and has been used notably by Lavrovsky ,  Ashton and MacMillan  ( see page 26 )  ;  and Ashton provided a roughly outlined plot for Hans Werner Henze 's  score for Ondine   ( 1958 )  .  But standing out above all are the scores commissioned from Stravinsky by Balanchine ,  such as Apollo ,  Orpheus  and Card Game  .  During the third phase of his enterprise Diaghilev realised the need to keep up with the tastes of his wealthy <head>audiences</head> always anxious to be in fashion and commissioned works from members of the group known as Les Six . These were Milhaud ,  Poulenc and Auric whose music greatly influenced many later composers such as William Walton and Constant Lambert ,  many of their works remain in constant use today as witness MacMillan 's  moving interpretation of Poulenc 's  Gloria  .  When choreographers decide to commission music ,  they should first give the composer an outline of the plot ,  roughly suggesting the sequence of the action ,  the likely entrances and exits for the characters and the dances or brief scenes in which they are involved .

The ballet works itself out consistently as a design ,  reproducing in the subtlest way the design of the music in the matter of subject ,  repetitions ,  balancings ,  treatment of episodes and so on .  In the last resort ,  the more musical we are and the better we know Brahms ,  the more pleasure we derive from Choreartium  .  Ernest Newman 's remarks stress that choreographers creating dance to their own choice of music must study how the composer has structured his score and try to understand what he intended the <head>audience</head> to hear and feel , whether it be played , or played and sung . Choreographers have to create dance movements which make their response to the music visible before the performers can communicate the music .  A socalled abstract or dance ballet has to be both thought and felt if the partnership between the often - dead composer and the living interpreters is to make sense .

A choreographer working in the classical style is wise to conform to the traditional principles and rules found valuable through years of experience .  They are based on a refinement of the natural movements made by the bones and joints when activated by the muscles ,  tendons and ligaments found in any human body .  The movements were and still are practised because they are designed to display the body as it moves to the best advantage from the <head>audience</head> 's point of view . They were and still are designed to give that style of dance spaciousness ,  calm ,  balance and grace of form so that the lines drawn during the transition from one step an/or pose to another fills the available space in every dimension .  In every enchanement  each step an/or pose must be given its appropriate value by way of beginning ,  climax and end so that its place is justified by its importance to the whole sentence .

Ashton and MacMillan adopt the same practice in their ballets which can be called classical in the court meaning of the term and whenever the music used is composed according to the formulae for classical composition .  They do this even though they may break the conventions from time to time .  They do it because they know the <head>audience</head> is watching a constantly evolving picture which is being drawn on , over , across and above a flat stage in front of a background . They know they must fill the empty space with movement ,  whether there is scenery in the background or where the costumes are at their simplest and the background merely a hint of some venue as ,  for example ,  in Symphonic Variations  or Requiem  ,  or even just shafts of light as in Monotones  .  It is useful for would - be choreographers to study the historical development of classical style so that they may stage a ballet in a traditional way when it has a story firmly linked to a particular time and place .

Perhaps the best example fur choreographers to study - is Petipa 's  work for the corps de ballet  ,  particularly in La Bayadre   ( Scene of the Shades )  .  As the thirty - six girls enter one by one down the ramp at the back of the stage and move into six straight lines across the stage until it is completely filled ,  there is one continually progressing line of arabesques  and ports de bras  .  This demonstrates what can be done with two simple movements to hold an <head>audience</head> 's attention . Later the mass of dancers merely moves upstage sur les pointes  to a pose and further ports de  bras  ,  then returns downstage to another slowly unfolding set of ports de bras  and arabesques  .  It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .

By so doing he originated a style of dance which owed its liveliness to the way such people behaved and danced in real life .  Even so ,  he did not fully dispense with the technique of the classical school .  He realised , as did later choreographers , that the steps and patterns of such material had to be properly displayed to the <head>audience</head> , not just danced for themselves . In other words he opened up the circles ,  squares and longways sets to show what gave rhythm and life to the movements .  It is this opening up and exposure of traditional dance that is so important when choreographers attempt to give a realistic atmosphere to the style and expression of their work .

Nineteenth - century choreographers creating either a character or a national ballet used both occupational and natural emotional gesture in their dance designs .

Yet the above ballets are different again from de Valois '  The Rake 's  Progress  ,  which was based on the reality of Hogarth 's  pictures .  When these pictures were issued they were indeed contemporary because they were based on the evils of the day .  Today 's <head>audiences</head> find them old - fashioned : yet many modern ballets deal with similar evils such as present - day problems with drugs , AIDS , mental handicap , racism , imprisonment and so on , in which the balletic interpretation makes the same impression if the choreographer has really studied the themes outlined in his subject . These choreographers must create movements which display each protagonist 's  particular behaviour and reactions .  Too often their movements are insufficiently defined because too much effort is made to shock ,  unlike the tightly controlled movements of characters in The Rake 's  Progress  and A Distant Drummer  .

By PATRICIA WYNN DAVIES ,  Legal Correspondent BARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldson ,  the Master of the Rolls ,  as he opened the Bar 's  annual conference in London at the weekend .  Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the plans of the Lord Chancellor , Lord Mackay of Clashfern , to give increased rights of <head>audience</head> in the High and Crown court to solicitors , Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma , the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's Green Papers and to abandon the hustings . Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's  Bill were total freedom of choice for the client ,  unless the interests of justice otherwise require .  When those concerned turn their attention to this problem ,  they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available .

ENO ,  I am glad to say ,  is proud to be dismissed by him to the purgatory reserved for this despicable activity ,  and more than 450,000 people pass through our doors each year to prove it .  If a composer remembers to keep this audience entertained ,  think what he can say to them all at the same time .  An entertained <head>audience</head> is actually there and listening : a bored one has usually gone to dinner . Rehearsing Kurt Weill 's  Street Scene ,  I am in daily contact with a composer who was not embarrassed to entertain ,  nor to adapt his vision to the audience .  When he arrived in America ,  Weill did not automatically expect New York ears to take to the music of the Berlin avant - garde in which he had played so prominent a part :  instead he set himself the task of learning to write music with an American accent .

By JAN SMACZNY THE MOST appealing moment in Mark - Anthony Turnage 's  engagingly chatty introduction to Three Screaming Popes ,  his Feeney commission premiere for the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at the Birmingham Town Hall ,  came with a stated desire that his music should be accessible to an audience .  Well , the Popes , in terrifying orchestral sonorities , certainly screamed and the new composition was , indeed , accessible to the <head>audience</head> . This substantial ,  15 - minute orchestral movement was inspired by three paintings of Innocent X by Francis Bacon ,  themselves based on Velasquez .  Taking a lead from the artist ,  Turnage subjected his original material ,  some Spanish dances ,  to techniques of submersion and distortion .

As is the case with most tournaments of this kind ,  there has to be a peg to hang it on ,  and this one is to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Jawaharlal Nehru .  It could just as well have been the 20th birthday of the Eden Gardens tea urn ,  and as far as the Indian government is concerned ,  there is nothing like an international cricket tournament for persuading the electorate that ,  with polling day just around the corner ,  Rajiv is the boy to vote for .  The proliferation of one - day cricket there were 227 limited - over internationals played between the last two World Cups is a reflection of modern - day <head>audience</head> demand , and , overseas anyway , is what brings in the cash . Even in a country like India ,  Test cricket no longer generates massive appeal ,  and on the last full tour there  by the West Indies  a 12 - match international programme was split 8 - 4 in favour of the instant thrill .  It is ,  of course ,  mere coincidence that Gooch 's  passage to India is considerably smoother for World Cups and Nehru Trophies than for a full England Test tour .

The one flaw is Page 's  abiding fondness for clever - clever partner work  his determination to find new means of supporting bodies ,  new ingenuities in the way the dancers intersect .  Certain duets thus feel like tortuous workshop explorations ,  with manoeuvres hard to do and awkward to watch ,  and it is these moments where Page seems to come adrift from the music .  The dancers , however , get an obvious and infectious thrill out of performing Piano , and apart from its minor longeurs , it is an equally fresh and exhilarating experience for the <head>audience</head> . On Friday night Piano faced stiff choreographic competition from Rubies ,  Requiem and Robbins 's  Other Dances ,  danced by Sylvie Guillem and Laurent Hilaire .  Their interpretation lacked soul ,  the dying fall of nostalgia and the abandon of passion being supplanted by a more relaxed air of complicity .

The only area an exile hopes to cultivate is what the Americans call the chicken and peas circuit  those endless dinners ,  lunches and buffet suppers by which the Conservative Party binds its supporters in a form of social cement out in the sticks .  By now Heseltine has probably got about as much mileage out of such occasions as he can reasonably expect .  He has certainly demonstrated that he is a draw : there must already be some 250 Conservative MPs in his debt for turning out an <head>audience</head> at least double that which they would otherwise have been able to collect . Part of the Heseltine strategy is ,  no doubt ,  based on the calculation that these debts one day can be collected  and certainly ,  within the Conservative Party 's  electoral college of MPs ,  he ought to have established some impressive lines of credit .  It is a nave aspirant party leader ,  though ,  who pins his faith to gratitude .

Public perceptions that the election was increasingly a two - horse race matched trends in published opinion polls but preceded television 's  switch towards marginalizing the Alliance by focusing on two - party controversy .  Except in so far as they publicized opinion poll findings ,  television projections of party credibility did not dictate public perceptions .  In contrast to television , the press was highly differentiated : different papers reached very different <head>audiences</head> with very different messages . While the pervasiveness and uniformity of television news made it unlikely that it would influence different people in different ways ,  the press seemed likely to influence different readers in very different ways .  Since political bias was so much a characteristic of the press we might expect its influence to be more apparent in terms of attitudes than perceptions ,  however .

Highbrow television ,  however ,  reached the politically interested almost irrespective of their  education level .

At the same time the <head>audience</head> pattern for highbrow television news seems more in keeping with the Public Service Ideal : reaching out to the interested public irrespective of social background . There was much less choice in terms of the media 's  political partisanship .

Despite the jitters the cost escalation has caused in the City ,  the French appear to be taking a more sanguine view .  At Banque Indosuez ,  one of the French underwriters of the project ,  Jean - Michel Plou ,  said the tunnel had gone too far to fail .  Once Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link , the consortium of firms building the tunnel , had produced more precise figures detailing the projected cost over - runs , the <head>banks</head> would be more willing to stump up the extra money , raising borrowing costs if necessary , he added . The fact that traffic estimates are not being increased to compensate for the rising construction costs is certain to raise fears that the cost of using the tunnel will be forced up by its scheduled opening in June 1993 .  Mr Morton is certain to face a City grilling on the latest cost and traffic estimates when Eurotunnel presents its interim results next Monday .

Bankers had expected that the fees for the Italy deal would be the standard 0.325 per cent .  According to reliable sources ,  however ,  Italy is paying only 0.25 per cent to its underwriters .  Bankers close to the deal say that Morgan Stanley was forced reluctantly to accept a lower commission structure because Italy was being offered this by other <head>banks</head> competing for the business . The fear now is that banks will start to compete by driving commission rates lower and lower until they are prepared to arrange issues at break - even or worse .  And this would vindicate those who believe that the market 's  ills are not going to be solved by tinkering with new issue processes ,  but rather by a drastic cutback in the overheads  ie ,  sacking people  being carried by the industry .

This ,  he said ,  would clear the way for an interim repayment to the depositors ,  and although there were some small administration problems ,  he saw no reason why this should not be done in the near future .  He said that although Raper and his henchman , Allen , had unlawfully exported large sums of money out of the UK 's jurisdiction , by the terms of the agreement the <head>bank</head> liquidators would take no voluntary part in any subsequent proceedings relating to the contempt charges . After the judgment ,  Mr Ashton was approached by a group of irate depositors and questioned about the return of their money .

Both the two - rig landing bays had moved into the banks on the centreline ,  and their combined crews ,  assisted by the ubiquitous bank support section ,  had connected the anchor ropes and the short ramp sections ,  Which were added to the main ramps to allow traffic easy access to the bridge .  The Troop Staff Sergeant detailed to supervise the construction was insistently calling the rafts into the head of the bridge ,  where they coupled on with remarkable rapidity .  The end of the bridge was clearly visible as it grew out of the far <head>bank</head> , and needed only a couple of rafts to make it complete . At that moment the men detailed as River Watchers radioed that a fast - moving vessel was coming downstream ,  and the Safety Officer ,  not at all sure of the newcomer 's  identity or intentions ,  fired an illuminating parachute flare over the nearly complete bridge to warn of the obstruction across its bows .  The Wasserschutz Polizei ,   or River Police launch ,  Whose arrival had been expected much earlier ,  turned on its blue flashing light and jauntily turned to take station upstream ,  in order to intercept any barge or ship choosing to ignore the river closure order which had been imposed by the river authorities for the night .

The street was soon cleared and an incident control point was set up. The RUC arrived ,  a sergeant in command .  The patrol commander had just finished briefing the police on the situation when one of the patrol shouted , There 's someone in the <head>bank</head> . The patrol gave cover as the police approached the building .  Just at that moment a man staggered out of the door of the bank ;  when he saw the tableau of police and soldiers in front of him ,  he threw his arms up in the air .

If he were alive today ,  he would have even more cause for satisfaction .

German art historians had <head>begun</head> much more systematically on this task than others . Several art historians wrote syntheses of art historical information ,  which became standard works .  Histories of art appeared in sequences of volumes by different authors ,  there were several series of books about artists and on museum collections ,  besides which the most comprehensive biographical dictionary of artists by Ulrich Thieme and Felix Becker started its long publication process in 1907 .

The status of comedy is crucial to the debate ,  and we can at least be sure that Kingsley Amis would not object to having his practice compared with Waugh 's  ,  or to being placed with him among the monologists of the Right .  Against this monologic Amis can be set ,  by way of alter ego ,  the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's  discussion of Difficulties with girls  ,  which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's  fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism ,  and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis ,  so often supposed an enemy of Modernism ,  is really a Modernist .  She <head>begins</head> by recalling a remark made to her a long time ago by Larkin , about difficulties encountered in his private life a remark which consisted of a joke to do with the impossibility of relations between men and women , followed by the notion that women ought really to marry each other , followed by but that would be wrong , would n't it ? And she notes that the same remark ,  or the same sentences ,  can be found in Amis 's  novel .  What interests her ,  apparently ,  is not the remark itself ,  but the degree to which the piece of recall  her piece of recall ,  presumably  failed to affect the novel in any way .

The prevailing protestant  loyalist beliefs stress the existence of the people of Northern Ireland ,  who are distinguished by their Ulster protestantism and democratic values ,  and by their claim to a flexible territory of Ulster .

A further central belief has recently <head>begun</head> to appear as equivocal , namely loyalism itself . Related to this is the final principal belief element ,  the conviction of the legitimacy of force in maintaining the subordination of catholic nationalists within the statelet .

Wine ,  at its simplest ,  means crushing grapes and letting the wild yeasts on the  the  skins ferment the sweet juices into alcohol .

When barley is harvested it is taken to a maltings where the grains are soaked in water to encourage germination .

Caramel is sometimes added to give darker colouring to the finished beer .

The finings attract yeast and other particles and <head>begin</head> to drag them to the bottom of the tank . Now the beer is ready for the final stage in the brewery before it leaves for the pub cellar .  It is run or racked into casks ,  made either of wood or metal ,  sometimes with some priming sugar and a handful of dry hops :  the sugar will encourage a vigorous secondary fermentation in the cask and the hops will add a delightful aroma .

A rapid winch launch will tend to pitch the glider back on to the tail ,  making a larger forward movement necessary to get the tail off the ground and so ensure a margin of speed when the aircraft takes off .  With all types of glider ,  it is wise to hold the stick right forward for the initial part of the ground run ,  so that there is no possibility of the glider zooming off the ground and into a steep climb if the winch driver applies full power too quickly .  However , as soon as it <head>begins</head> to accelerate smoothly , that movement is no longer necessary , and the control should be moved to get the glider balanced nicely on to the main wheel . Care must be taken not to keep the stick  forward for too long ,  as too much forward movement during the take - off run will prevent the glider from leaving the ground until a much higher speed is reached .  It is also undesirable because ,  if the glider is bounced off by bumpy ground ,  it will fly back into the ground heavily a few moments later .

No one brought up in the Jewish faith with his sort of European connections could fail to be unaware ,  or convulsed ,  by the nightmare we call the Holocaust .  Nightmares and night - time anxiety ,  are a regular feature of Leonard 's  work ,  though he did remark to us ,  I do n't think  that I was scarred by anything .

It may well be that his nocturnal anxieties began on hearing the nightly ministrations by which his father was nursed  to a young boy ,  eerie and mysterious ,  doubtless at times frenetic ;  no doubt they were exacerbated after his death ,  as sorrow and loss impinged .  Night itself occurs several times in his early books of poetry ,  as it was bound to do ,  and its references are of an intimidating sort :  the night never ending  ( in Letter )  ,  and the clinic of your thighs against the night  ( in Let Us Compare Mythologies  ;  the latter intimating that other experience of the night which such high thinkers as Bertrand Russell found laden with sexual feelings )  .

More recently ,  and perhaps begging the question of its mental significance ,  it has come to be known as the Readiness Potential  ( RP )  .  In Libet 's  experiment ,  subjects were asked to move their hands at random times of their own choosing .  Averaging the EEG over forty such self - initiated movements , Libet found that there was indeed a time - locked negative shift <head>beginning</head> about 550 msec before the movement . Whatever the particular significance of these RPs in terms of information processing ,  it is reasonable to conclude with Libet that 550 msec is the minimum interval by which neural activity precedes a self - initiated ,  and therefore presumably voluntary ,  movement .  At the same time ,  Libet set up a procedure for allowing subjects to report the time at which they first experienced the conscious intention to act .

With a low - powered winch or tow car ,  the acceleration is far slower and there is plenty of time to get the glider nicely balanced on the wheel so that it leaves the ground with a safe margin of speed .  Again ,  if the acceleration is poor the climb must not be steepened quickly or it will be impossible to recover in time if the launch fails .  The <head>climbing</head> angles for winch or car tow can be similar once the initial climb is over .

But it is the glider pilot who literally has the life of the tow pilot in his hands .  Remember ,  do not hold the glider down too close to the ground ,  5 to 10 feet is safer .  Be ready to ease up to stay in position as the tug starts to <head>climb</head> . If you get out of position and if you find yourself too low ,  move up slowly in small steps ,  checking the movement every few feet .  Don't try to move to the correct position too quickly .

Undaunted ,  he returned a week later and made the first clean ascent .  In fact The Crack is a much more interesting climb than the name would suggest .  At least a third of the route takes the steep open wall to the left of the corner and the climb as a whole demands a wide range of <head>climbing</head> technique . Even the first pitch ,  escaping left from the steep corner ,  demands positive commitment and the ability to confidently tackle technical wall climbing .  The next pitch ,  stepping from the exposed top of the pinnacle block ,  is again a bold exercise ,  one immediately followed by a forced mantleshelf move to gain a horizontal weakness in the smooth wall .

But given the discrimination shown against climbers in the present price structure , how long might it be before you <head>climb</head> at High Rocks by season ticket , or prior arrangement and private fee only ? No ,  this arrangement does climbers no favours .  Given the delicate access positions at other sandstone crags it is an inept and unhelpful piece of privateering .

Again ,  much interest attaches to interpretation ,  as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure .

But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed ,  with clergy being left behind in some areas ,  the clerics remain the true cognoscenti  in religious matters ,  and are expected to be so by the laity .  This has always added to the clergy 's spiritual authority and status , and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals , with the high clergy <head>deciding</head> what constitutes matters of faith and morals . The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .

The story of how the traditional management through the regions has been transformed into a marketing one based on the sectors is told elsewhere .  So Far as InterCity is concerned sector management has brought two major benefits :  overall responsibility for deployment of its rolling stock fleet ,  and the building of a national range of express train products .  The first example of equipment redeployment came in 1982 when the then director ( Cyril Bleasdale ) , faced with a serious downturn on Great Western sub - sector services out of Paddington , <head>decided</head> to move ten HSTs to the Midland main line so that a badly needed improvement could be implemented on this potentially profitable and much neglected route . Under the previous organisation it would have taken months of internal wrangling to resolve the conflicting aspirations of regionally based management .  Transfer of all Anglo - Scottish sleeping car services from the East to the West Coast main line from May 1988 was a similar decision based on a corporate rather than a regional viewpoint .

By the late seventies some British academics were displaying a wary but sympathetic interest in early or classical structuralism ,  particularly as it was expounded in Culler 's  widely read Structuralist Poetics  ,  a lucid ,  urbane work which suggested that structuralism might ,  without too much difficulty ,  be adopted to existing academic practice .  I was partly convinced by Culler 's  power of persuasion ,  and for some time thought that the kinds of analysis he described could be assimilated to practical criticism and the English synthesis .  Eventually I <head>decided</head> that assimilation was not possible , given Culler 's lack of interest in the interpretation of particular texts and his commitment to the uncovering of the generalized principles of literariness . In Structuralist Poetics  Culler took an unenthusiastic view of deconstructionism ,  but he shortly  returned to the United States and succumbed to the deconstructive wave that swept through the American academy in the late seventies ,  and into which I did not feel inclined to plunge .  David Lodge was another established British academic and writer who took an early interest in formalist and structuralist methods and principles .

Louis Untermeyer ,  Robert Frost 's  correspondent who was to be an influential anthologist ,  wrote of Poems  ( The Freeman  ,  30 June 1920 )  that Eliot cares more for his art than he does for his attitudes ;  and that the exaltation which is the very breath of poetry  that combination of tenderness and toughness  is scarcely ever present in Eliot 's  lines .  When The Waste Land  appeared ,  Untermeyer had become more irate :  The Dial 's   award to Mr T. S. Eliot and the subsequent bookpublication of his The Waste Land  have occasioned a display of some of the most enthusiastically naive superlatives that have ever issued from publicly sophisticated iconoclasts .  The poem itself he found a pompous parade of erudition , and he <head>decided</head> that were it not for the Laforgue mechanism , Mr Eliot s poetic variations on the theme of a super - refined futility would be increasingly thin and incredibly second rate ( The Freeman , 17 January 1923 ) . Obviously a writer who is happy with super - refined  ( elsewhere he says that Eliot 's  Portrait of a Lady is extraordinarily sensitized )  is not a critic worth pausing on for long ;  and yet when Untermeyer cites all too patent imitations of Eliot 's  Sweeney Among the Nightingales in quatrains by Osbert Sitwell and Herbert Read and Robert Nichols ,  one can see good reason for him to think that Eliot s reputation ,  achieved so fast on such a slender body of work ,  was no more than modish .  And indeed it asks no great exertion of the historical imagination to recognize that ,  at a time when the Sitwells were taken to be modernists equal with Eliot and Pound ,  modish  was just what Eliot 's  reputation was .

As will be elaborated now in further contexts ,  it appears that the underlying reality to such difficulties was ,  and remains a complex contradiction which the catholic  nationalist alliance has still failed to solve .  On the one hand there were the beliefs in the nature and extent of the clergy 's  political religious power and how that power was to be exercised in the state .  There was also the general assumption that the fact of a state populated by catholics must perforce imply a heightened <head>degree</head> of institutionalized catholic value in law. On the other hand ,  there was the nationalist theory of democracy ,  which derives power from the people and not from an lite group of religious intellectuals .  The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s .

In this situation ,  the marginal mover acquires the power to reinterpret the way his institutional structure governs a desire for a rigidified world of immobility ,  and to understand why ,  for example ,  those few policemen who move into other areas ,  such as probation work or the legal profession ,  become totally suspect .  Transition to the outside destroys the manufactured reality of one real world and two ex - police probation officers I knew became  the equivalent of potential prigs .  Again it is this incomprehension of social mobility which seems to have caused my ACC to describe an officer who took a <head>degree</head> and then left to become a solicitor as a bad experience for the force ( and not a gain for society ) . And it is the same logic which attributes those few out of the 120,000 officers who pursue schemes designed to accelerate promotion with the derisory and metaphorically ephemeral classification of high - flyers or butterfly boys .  I now see that between 1958 and 1977 I was involved in what might well be described as a social drama of movement ,  often crossing boundaries into very marginal areas of policing ,  where the institutional ideal of ordered definition fails simply because the use of power and exercise of authority are based in ambiguity and particular interpretations of what is often poorly framed legislation  ( Burton 1980 )  .

The interesting part is that the measuring fibre does not need to be part of the current carrying circuit , giving a high <head>degree</head> of electrical isolation . The physical basis of the measurement leads to a linear response over a wide dynamic range ,  and reduces saturation and hysteresis effects .

There was a critical paper in the Oxford <head>degree</head> , but the emphasis was substantially on scholarship of a tough traditional kind , without much concession to the Arnoldian free play of mind . For a long time Oxford English was directed towards scholarship and was suspicious of criticism ,  and this attitude was reflected in its house organ ,  The Review of English Studies  .  Helen Gardner ,  for many years an Oxford luminary ,  did not believe that the purpose of English was to turn out critics ,  any more than it was to produce poets and novelists .

The canon would be largely English ,  not for a priori nationalistic reasons ,  but because it is written in English ,  and until fairly recently most poetry written in English was also written in England ,  or at least ,  in the British Isles .  There is no reason why American poetry ,  or poetry from other anglophone literatures ,  should not be read ,  given a minimal amount of culture and contextual instruction  ( which may also be needed ,  of course ,  in the reading of English poems )  .  To what extent students on such a <head>degree</head> would also need to read poetry in another language is a difficult question . In principle it is extremely desirable ,  not only because of the basic otherness of foreign poetry ,  but because such knowledge gives one a better sense of what English poetry can and cannot do .  In practice ,  given the monoglot tendency in secondary education it might be difficult to recruit students with the necessary competence .

The academic study of music may be a specialist field ,  but music ,  of every kind ,  is widely diffused and performed ;  only a small percentage of those attending concerts or recitals will have taken degrees in music .  Similarly ,  one would like to see a state of affairs in which many more people read and enjoyed poetry than had taken a degree in it .  The <head>degree</head> in poetry I have outlined would attempt to be open about its theoretical assumptions . I do not believe there is any absolute virtue in such openness ,  in fact ,  I think that education is ideally carried on in a shared form of life where there is agreement about fundamentals and attention can be concentrated on the task in hand .  But no such state of affairs exists in our culture ,  and it is self - delusory and damaging to pretend that it does .

The general impression conveyed by the earlier centuries is one of wisdom ,  harmony ,  humanity .

Each is different in mild <head>degrees</head> and minor sensations from its neighbours . But because each refuses to acknowledge its neighbours ,  the net effect in terms of the streetscape is less than zero .  Some of the buildings are faced in a swathe of reflective glass that merely reflects other mundane buildings ,  some in brick ,  some with half - hearted Post - Modern details .

Which has been better governed since the war ,  Britain or ,  say ,  the Federal Republic of Germany ?  Economies ,  it would appear ,  thrive on the kind of continuity which coalition government helps to provide .  They also benefit from the higher <head>degree</head> of social solidarity which seems to accompany more pluralistic systems . Such systems ,  moreover ,  encourage incrementalist rather than ideological approaches ,  which have resulted in a successful mix of market economics and welfare .

Mr Heseltine has long advocated an extension of such agencies to other British regions ,  and Sir Geoffrey 's  new - found support could signal Cabinet debate on industrial policy  an issue which has been omitted from this week 's  conference agenda .

Above all ,  does not the cross show that this is how God always acts in and towards the world ,  eternally vulnerable to the worst of pain and suffering which it manifests ?  Now ,  as John Bowker has pointed out in the first article in this series ,  to say that God is not affected by His creatures is not to say that He takes no interest in them ,  nor that ,  seen from our viewpoint as creatures in time and space ,  God cannot do one thing at one moment and something apparently quite different the next .  It is inevitable and right that if we are to make God real for ourselves we must , to a considerable <head>degree</head> , speak of Him in human terms , which is what the Bible does when it speaks of Him as repenting , changing His mind , being provoked or made angry or sorrowful . But we must never forget the inadequacy of all human language before the mystery of God 's  essential being ,  of God as God .  What is important is that God always acts towards us with an outbreak of invariable love ,  the expression of His unchanging nature .

Some of these are worth highlighting in greater detail as a means of contextualizing the data and illustrating some of the social processes operating upon them .  One of the consequences of the RUC 's  dual role is that it has features typical of most police forces and qualities special to it .  This is reflected in the respondents ' sensitivity towards the police management , an enduring theme in the conversation of ordinary policemen and women in any force , and towards the terrorist threat , which is not faced by others to the same <head>degree</head> . The latter makes what is already an internally homogeneous organization even more enclosed and protective .  As one constable put it ,  I do n't mind you being here ,  I do n't mind you taking notes .

Cumberbatch 1983 ,  Taylor - Griffiths 1988 )  .  Nor is the idea of community policing popular amongst ordinary constables in other sections of the police ,  often because it contradicts their views of what constitutes real police work ,  but also because they have misguided notions about what community policing is ,  as well as a practical awareness of the unrealistic expectations held of it by enthusiasts .  In the RUC , for example , a group of policemen and women taking a police studies <head>degree</head> were asked their opinions on community policing , and the following remarks are typical : What gets me about this guy Alderson is that he served in the country area of Cornwall ,  and he makes all these proposals about inner - city policing ;  now how the hell would he know anything about the inner city ?  All this community policing stuff is all very well ,  but has it worked ?

As an example ,  consider the difficulty experienced by overseas companies wishing to begin direct operations in Japan ,  where applications were vetted by the National Planning Authority to ensure that they fitted the national economic plan of Japan .  At best ,  admission was obtained only on the basis of a joint venture with a Japanese company ,  and entry of any kind was often impossible to obtain ,  at least until the Japanese themselves had established a strong presence  domestically and internationally  in the market sector concerned .  This situation has been ameliorated to a <head>degree</head> , in the face of overseas pressure to change the system , not least because of the Japanese need to maintain its market position in other countries , and concern about retaliatory measures against Japanese imports . This sort of interdependence of interests is a feature of the relations between industrialised countries ;  having built a strong overseas market position ,  a country will be forced to take more account of external pressures if that strong position is to be maintained .  The future behaviour of Japan ,  then ,  may be analysed in terms of the balance between commercial self - interest and the basic protectionist nature of many of the trade restrictions which still exist .

Political balance cannot be achieved by criticizing one party during the mid - term of a parliament and another at election time .  Indeed that may be a more subtle form of propaganda than a constant barrage of criticism .  By criticizing the Conservative Party mid - term the right - wing press can build up a certain <head>degree</head> of credibility with its readers which it can then use to maximum effect by suspending criticism of the Conservative Party and increasing its attacks on Labour as the election approaches . Anecdotal evidence suggests that the tabloid press stores up suitable material for use in election campaigns .  Editors do think explicitly about timing and they are not motivated merely to be the first to print a scoop :  they keep stories until the  time is ripe .

His survival over the years since independence in 1961 does not alter the fact that the discussion of real policy choices in a public manner has hardly ever occurred .  This is not to say that the National Executive Committee of the ruling party allows Nyerere total control of the party and therefore of government policy ;  in fact there have always been a number of important policy issues which Nyerere has had to argue through the NEC and which he has not always won .  One such issue since the Union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964 has been the <head>degree</head> of influence of leading Zanzibari politicians in the affairs of the mainland government and party , and the status of Zanzibar in general . Another ,  in the late 1960s ,  was the position of the Ruvuma Development Association  ( RDA )  ,  a group of seven villages near Songea in the extreme south - western corner of Tanzania which grouped themselves in an association of mutual support designed to foster their development and which were ultimately compulsorily disbanded in 1969 .

The existence of the gentile constitution shows that order can exist without the State .

Yet the fact that many primitive peoples regulate interpersonal relations with a fair <head>degree</head> of predictability and humanity , without the help of a centralized political system , is one that most anthropologists would now endorse ; however , unlike Engels , they do this without pointing out the political implications of such an observation . For Engels ,  by contrast ,  the possibility revealed by the gentile constitution was a major guarantee that the Marxist vision of the withering away of the State in a future communist society was not a recipe for chaos ,  as was argued by his opponents .  The correlation which Morgan and Engels make between very simple agriculture and herding and the gentile constitution is a rare example of a proposition of this kind which has held up fairly well in the light of recent research .

The influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated  ( if overstated )  in these books .  If the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed  ( SI through Fluxus ,  Heatwave ,  King Mob ,  Jamie Reid ,  Vivienne Westwood ,  and the Sex Pistols )  the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence  ( typified by King Mob in Britain ,  the Motherfuckers in the USA ,  and also indirectly the punk phenomenon )  but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life .  The political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large <head>degree</head> derives from Marx 's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism , Lukcs 's development of this critique , and the Marxist - existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre . The rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists away from dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences .  The ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his Workers '  Council  after World War One provided a ready - made model of a non - hierarchical political system .

He suggested that cattle grazing in the ideal landscape should be any other colour than black and white ,  which make together the most inharmonious of all mixtures .  Gilpin 's  theories on the return to pastoralism had a profound effect on his contemporaries ,  and from them ,  together with much sentimental theory from Sir Uvedale Price and Richard Payne Knight ,  a distinctly picturesque architecture evolved .

The salt retains the extracted moisture ,  thus inhibiting the growth of bacteria which require moisture to flourish in the food .  Before refrigeration ,  salting was about the only process reliable enough to preserve meat .  The same principle is still used , to a lesser <head>degree</head> , where vegetables containing bitter juices , such as aubergines and courgettes , are sprinkled with salt and then left until the juices have been drawn from the flesh . Vegetables treated in this way must be washed very thoroughly before use to remove both the extracted juices and the surplus salt .  Saltpetre ,  or potassium nitrate ,  is a preserving salt usually available only at a chemist 's  or pharmacy and is most commonly used to preserve the pink colour of pickled or salt beef .

The ratio of brain weight to spinal cord weight is considered a better measurement of complexity and intelligence .  In fishes ,  the brain weighs less than the spinal cord ;  in the horse the ratio is about 2.5 to 1 ;  in the cat 5 to 1 ;  in apes about 8 to 1 ;  and in humans about 50 to 1 .  The bottlenose dolphin has an average ratio of 40 to 1 , the dusky dolphin about 35 to 1 , and Dall 's porpoise about 26 to 1 , suggesting that dolphins generally show a <head>degree</head> of intelligence comparable with that of humans .

Not only in law ,  but in ordinary life ,  we look upon an act done by one man in pursuance of another 's  orders as done by the person who gives the order .

A man is not punishable for a serious crime committed by another unless he has actually instigated the commission of a crime ,  and then he will be punishable though the crime committed may differ in some degree from that which he instigated .  It may be noted that in Criminal Law anyone who aids ,  counsels ,  or procures the commission of an offence is liable to be tried and punished in the same way as if he were a principal offender .

I suspect it is no  accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police image ,  or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars ,  Superman  ,  and the like .  In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces , the nuances of uniform <head>difference</head> were always embroidered by real polises to produce symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers . Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .

The police also use concepts of a disciplined body in their dealings to effect the capture of the local villains  ( or prigs )  .  In any public confrontation a quick assessment and early resolution is the order of the day ,  for on the streets pragmatism always rules and real polises set out immediately to fix their adversaries by using deeply imbued constructs relating to time and space .

Manzano has drawn attention to a real <head>difference</head> when he says ( of both these first books ) , In general Cohen is lyrical in his writings when he refers to himself , and anarchistic when he confronts the outside world , a comment which becomes more fully justified as time goes by , though Leonard 's anarchism remained personal and mainly verbal . He is wont to talk of the new vision that Lorca 's  poetry gave to him ;  here is my landscape ,  he exclaimed repeatedly .

How is a cognisant episode such as this going to be analysed away into the language of activity ?  Well clearly it is not  going to yield to any such analysis ,  and to believe that it will is to deny the reality of subjective life and to side with the behaviourists .  What I can say , however , is that the constructivist position allows a distinctive analysis of the mental when we speak of a mental representation of a green patch : it helps us to understand the <head>difference</head> between mental representations and the non - mental variety ( a photograph for example ) . At the time of looking up we ascribe an experience of greenness to ourselves ;  we consider the experience as something being undergone by us before any decision is taken about its veridicality .  Such an ascription is a cognisant act involving ,  at the very least ,  a conception of a one 's  self ,  a conception of experience ,  and a conception of veridicality .

Light hearted With regard to the debate about c  and Doppler shifts in the letters pages ,  light  ( velocity c  )  reflected or emitted from a surface moving with velocity v  towards an observer appears to be blue shifted ,  or red shifted in the case of a receding surface .

From JOHN ROBERTS in Stuttgart FACIAL expressions made it difficult to guess who was the man on a working honeymoon here yesterday .  In tennis terms , the <head>differences</head> in demeanours of the newly wed Ivan Lendl and the newly awakened Henri Leconte was that of one player whose year has ended and another whose may be about to begin . Lendl ,  still trying to push the disappointment of his United States Open defeat by Boris Becker to the back of his mind and impatient for another crack at the elusive Wimbledon title ,  appeared to be going through the motions during his round - robin match at the Stuttgart Classic .  Leconte ,  by contrast ,  hit the ball with the joy of a player savouring rare moments free of physical pain and won ,  6 - 4 ,  7 - 6 .

The dock strike failed because the transport workers did not have the strength to defend the labour monopoly enjoyed by registered dockers in a number of ports once the Government removed its statutory underpinning .  At much the same time ,  however ,  workers on British Rail successfully defended their procedures in the courts and subsequently went on to conduct a very effective strike from which they emerged victorious .  Unions are demonstrating a growing sophistication and success in their use of the law , while the courts are increasingly aware of the <head>difference</head> between an employer who is frivolously testing his rights to its limits and an enterprise with genuine reason for seeking an interim injunction . But the most dispiriting aspect of yesterday 's  debate was the preoccupation which union delegates had with rendering the strike weapon more effective .

That ,  in a later work of extensive and original research into little - known source material ,  carried out in partnership with his wife Marian ,  Keeton should have something to say in favour of Lord Chancellor Jeffreys ,  brought him little joy from quarters whose traditional schoolboy images he chose to query .  So it would be possible to go on :  anybody who wishes to do so will find plenty of relevant material in the conscientious bibliography by Sultana Saeed in Law Justice and Equity :  essays in tribute to GW Keeton  ( 1967 )  .  The closest comparison with another polymath in our time that , in spite of personal and other <head>differences</head> , comes to mind is with Arnold Toynbee . The common denominator is less the substratum of overlapping spheres of knowledge than intuitive awareness and ,  even more so ,  shared condemnation from disdainful detractors .

The simple <head>difference</head> in rugby intellect plus a glaring weakness in Newport 's defensive cover allowed Cardiff to improve a 12 - 9 interval deficit with four second - half tries . The best Newport had to offer was a solid front row ,  the line - out jumping of their veteran lock ,  David Waters ,  and a passion which ,  in the case of 19 - year - old No. 8 Ian McKim ,  needs restraining .  McKim ,  a Wales youth player last season and new to some of the more unwelcome machinations of senior rugby ,  lost his temper so totally after a brush with the Cardiff prop Jeff Whitefoot that he even lashed out at Newport 's  skipper ,  Glen George ,  who was trying to cool him down.

Lower trade barriers permitted their development ,  and Japanese government restrictions on overseas investment encouraged companies that treated markets on a global basis and benefitted from economies of scale .

To some extent the <head>difference</head> between this view and the developmental approach is one of semantics : the term global company does not mean the same to each . Yet there is greater emphasis in the transnational company model on the complete integration and interdependence of operating structures .

These findings broadly echo those of Gunter ,  Svennevig ,  and Wober  ( 1986 ,  pp.989 )  ,  whose study of the 1983 election campaign showed that objectively measured knowledge was significantly correlated with interest  in political discussion programmes both on radio and television ,  but with only one news - consumption  variable  claimed viewing of television news  ( italics added )  .  In our analysis of the 1987 campaign we have distinguished more  clearly between personal factors such as political interest and mobilizing factors such as television viewing ;  and we have detected a strong trend in the balance of influence between these two influences .  In the Pre - Campaign Wave there was a 41 per cent <head>difference</head> in awareness of polls between those with a high and low interest in politics . Following J. S. Coleman 's  terminology we can say that the effect of political interest on awareness of opinion polls was 41 per cent in the pre - Campaign Wave .

It is difficult to see that as anything other than an attempt to intimidate the BBC .

Our comparison of BBC - TV with ITV in Chapter 5 showed that there was little <head>difference</head> between them . Our opinion survey in Chapter 6 showed that most voters felt television news on both networks was unbiased ;  but amongst the minority who felt it  was biased a majority thought it was biased towards the Conservatives and against both Labour and the Alliance .

In discussing Drer ,  he treated him as the most versatile artist of a triumvirate ,  whose other members were Marcantonio Raimondi and Lucas van Leyden .  Of the latter he wrote ,  Lucas van Leyden is an artist of frailer calibre than Drer ,  and prone to lose himself in imitation of stronger men ,  each of his contemporaries in turn dominating his style .  Another book about the age of Drer , but on a <head>different</head> topic , is The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany , by Michael Baxandall , published in 1980 . The author started his career in the Victoria and Albert Museum ,  where there is an important group of this sculpture ;  his book had a double origin in a museum exhibition and a series of lectures .  Divisions in the book are unusually clear ,  separate chapters being given to topics such as function ,  the market ,  or the historical and political background of the subject .

Instead ,  he put a rich range of clear rainbow colours on his palette ,  replacing the dirty ochre colours with light and more luminous chromium colours ,  with the addition of Veronese green ,  ultramarine and lacquer colours ,  and following the Impressionist recipe in not mixing these colours with anything except white or closely allied colours .  Interpretation of the artist 's  work ,  however ,  depends on the artist 's  own account ,  since Nordenfalk had the deliberate intention of presenting Van Gogh the writer and thinker .  The sober intentions of his book were very <head>different</head> from the novels , plays and films which have created a mythical figure in modern culture of the artist as isolated and neglected , recognised only after his death , and whom the phrase genius and madness are near aligned seems to fit . The novel Lust for Life  by Irving Stone ,  published in 1934 ,  is the most famous of these productions ,  popularising a vein of interpretation established early in the century by some of Van Gogh 's  first advocates ,  such as the taste - maker Julius Meier - Graefe ,  who defended Van Gogh in 1906 ,  and went on to write a book in his praise in 1921 called Vincent  .  But this was a drama ,  the story of the circumstances of Van Gogh 's  life ;  No attempt has  been made ,  wrote Meier - Graefe ,  to make a critical analysis of the pictures ,  which enter upon the scene only in so far as they concern the drama directly or indirectly .

A first broad division between types of exhibitions needs to be made .

The catalogues which accompany these events have rather <head>different</head> characters , for although there are entries for the exhibited works in each sort of catalogue , and usually an introduction , historical catalogues often have additional essays . Catalogues of major shows have also become bigger and more expensive in recent years ,  usually through the help of national ,  industrial or commercial sponsorship .  A characteristic historical exhibition may be called something like The Age of Rembrandt ,  or Shock of Recognition ;  the landscape of English Romanticism and the Dutch seventeenth - century school ;  both of these are actual titles .

Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of image - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is .  In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The images carry <head>different</head> information . The physical make - up of dots in a photograph differs from the lines and granular surface of the aquatint ;  the aquatint 's  variations describe the picture more eloquently .  The art of civilisations other than that of the West are now more readily visible through photography ,  and within the limitations of the medium ,  usefully so .

After an eight - hour shift we went home  off duty  free men ,  while they in contrast went to their police houses and were available for discretional duty ,  at the call of the system twenty - four hours a day ;  proving we were independent free men and they were slaves !  All of these social differences were em -   bodied in the symbol of uniform .  Our expensive , good - quality tunics were well cut and belted , while our guard style cap , set up at the front to emulate the officer class , made us <head>different</head> . Helmets and unbelted tunics were for the despised county men ,  those sheep - dippers up the road in the sticks whom we continually used to reassert our own status by looking on them as hicksville country cousins and definitely not real polises .

A good performance in the B or regional squads may bring you to the attention of the national coach ,  and may also result in your promotion to the lite squads .

Some people do well in these but not so well in the squad ( and vice versa ) , presumably because of the <head>different</head> pressures each brings to bear . Though you may pick up some new techniques ,  the national squads are basically designed to select already gifted karateka rather than teach karate tactics or techniques .  Wear a clean white karategi and bring your groin guard/ breast shield ,  shin/instep protectors and mitts .

Some of these changes will be related to neural processes that have little psychological relevance .

Given this ,  the progress that has been made is remarkable ,  particularly in relating components of the ERP to attentional processes .

You see ,  when you are working in plan like this it is difficult to bear in mind that machine table heights can work in your favour and they can also work against you .  For example ,  if you have the situation where you want to put two occasionally - used machines quite close to one another ,  it may be to your advantage that their heights are exactly the same so the job can run across both tables .  The converse of this can apply if your table heights are at <head>different</head> levels . Most bandsaws ,  for example ,  have a table considerably above the common machine table height which may enable you to cast long jobs above other machines .  Most planer - thicknessers have a thicknessing table below common machine height ,  so position your thicknesser very carefully .

The catalogue of the earlier Italian schools was written by Martin Davies ,  and published in 1951 .  the strength of the gallery 's  holding of works by Giovanni Bellini made it worth the author 's  while to write a preliminary note about difficulties of attribution :  A definition of Bellini 's  oeuvre is one of the hardest problems in the history of painting .  The first <head>difficulty</head> is , despite the destructions , the enormous number of existing pictures , many of them signed , and in one way or another more or less Bellinesque . It is obvious that Bellini had assistants to help him in his studio ;  indeed ,  there is documentary proof of that .  But the question of what pictures are entirely or for practical purposes Bellini 's  own is answered largely by personal taste ;  there is therefore a considerable divergence of view .

A play really demands to be read aloud  - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive .

Here is a suggested first reading list ,  which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's  development .  There is a danger in reading the classics ,  in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature  so always try to look at them as plays for performance   and ,  it goes without saying ,  try to see as much theatre as you can .

Philips ,  the Dutch electronics company which invented the CD ,  long ago dropped its original advertising slogan :  Perfect sounds forever .  A spokesman said yesterday that the company promised a lifetime 's  use if the CDs were manufactured correctly .

The main problem is that the stored sound can be lost when the thin layer of aluminium which coats a CD 's  plastic surface is oxidised ,  losing its ability to reflect laser light .  European CD manufacturers have begun a regular exchange of information on quality to help improve the discs '  longevity and hope to agree on an international standard testing procedure involving exposure of the discs to heat and humidity .

Its vacillations of mood ,  from white - hot passion concealed behind a frosty stare to an almost insouciant dance - like gaiety ,  are beautifully captured in a generally distinguished performance by the Danish Radio orchestra under Leif Segerstam .  The disc is filled out with the tone - poems Pohjola 's  Daughter and En Saga ,  the latter  ( I always think )  just five minutes too long .  Abbado 's latest <head>disc</head> as Karajan 's Berlin successor is devoted to Brahms : cogent and altogether admirable performances of the Fourth Symphony and Haydn Variations to join the many others of which the same could be said . What makes this disc worth having is the setting for chorus and orchestra of Schiller 's  Nanie ,  composed in memory of a friend .  This is Brahms at his most radiant and affecting ,  music of such intimacy that one is not surprised to learn that its suitability for public performance was questioned .

The starfish are among the most important of invertebrate predators living today .  They make major depredations on oyster beds and the recent activities of the Crown of Thorns starfish  (  Acanthaster  )  in chewing up great chunks of the Great Barrier Reef have become a modern ecological object lesson  ( and ,  incidentally ,  a source of funds for many marine biologists )  .  There are two major kinds of starfish ( which may not be closely related ) the familiar large , stiff - armed asteroids , and the delicate ophiuroids , brittle stars , with lithe , slender , snake - like arms radiating from a circular central <head>disc</head> . Ophiuroids are especially abundant in deep sea environments ,  and it is unusual for a deep sea dredge to miss one of these small animals .

The next milestone was the idea of mass - producing copies of recordings .  This involved making a negative version of the recording ,  with ridges instead of grooves ,  so the copies could be formed from that .  The <head>disc</head> records invented by Berliner were the first to possess this advantage , since they could be stamped out almost like printing . They also permitted a much simpler reproducing machine ,  since the groove itself propelled the soundbox ,  no additional screw mechanism being necessary  ( 7 )  .  At first ,  the playing time for both discs and cylinders was the same  about two minutes  but the fact that discs could be made in different sizes ,  all of which could be played on the same machine ,  was another advantage .

The next day Walter Miller of the Edison Company was asked whether all the musical records he sent would have the title on the end of the cylinder ,  as they had seen arranged at the laboratory the day before ,  to which he replied ,  Yes sir ,  they will be fixed up that way .  However ,  it was not to be ;  the Edison company preferred to market the phonograph as a dictation machine ,  and nearly a decade went by before cylinder moulding became a commercial reality .  In the meantime , Berliner 's first <head>disc</head> records were made in Germany , and these definitely had labels of a sort ( 25 , 26 ) . The only doubt concerns the date ;  it seems these early records could be from any year between 1889 and 1891 ,  so whether Edison or Berliner was actually first to make records with a label is open to debate .  The conventional paper label was never possible on a cylinder ,  since there was insufficient flat space .

It was normal practice for the trademark to occupy the upper half of the design ,  while the title and other details occupied the lower half .  The exceptions are sufficiently rare to be worth a study on their own ;   it was quite a challenge for designers to make effective use of a relatively small circular area with a hole in the middle .  The challenge became even greater with the advent of 45rpm <head>discs</head> , which had to be provided with an optional centre no less than an inch and a half in diameter for quick - acting autochange and juke - box mechanisms . Designers therefore could not use the middle of the label to carry vital information .  It is not so much the label which affects the collectability of early rock records ,  but the nature of this optional centre .

Probably the first long - playing disc records were made by the Neophone Company of London in 1904 ;  they were twenty inches in diameter .  The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures ,  but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each ,  and needed an outsize turntable .  So customers spent their money on twelve - inch <head>discs</head> instead , and in fact I have never seen a twenty - inch Neophone record . The Marathon discs of 1912  ( 48 )  were made in the usual ten - inch and twelve - inch diameters ,  but with finer grooves .  The idea was to record using hill - and - dale modulation ,  with the grooves packed closer together because there would be no risk of overlap .

The new <head>discs</head> were also hill - and - dale , recorded with a relatively fine groove - pitch of 150 lines per inch , so a ten - inch side played rather longer than usual ( about five minutes ) . The grooves were U - bottomed with a radius of precisely 4.7 thousandths of an inch ,  and his reproducers were fitted with the very  first diamond styli ,  of exactly this size for minimum wear and surface - noise .  But the grooves were very shallow by normal disc standards ,  and to reduce the chances of the stylus being thrown out of the groove ,  the records were made absolutely flat ,  and a full quarter of an inch thick so they would be sure to stay that way .

Alternatively ,  we could use an electronically - controlled variable - speed turntable ,  but we have no absolute way of knowing what the correct speed is .

How could she compare the  task of dusting and polishing the magnificent English furniture to the drudgery of cleaning our house ,  where there were only tom rags ,  a broom and a pail of water ,  and you had to go down on your knees to scrub the floor and do the endless piles of washing by hand ?  The man at the British customs was much sterner than the magistrate who came from the capital to investigate crimes committed in our village .

The amount of calories a person needs each day is determined by the type of work they do ,  the exercise they take and their metabolic rate .  It is very simple to work out the amount of calories needed each day .  For 7 days count the calories in every piece of food you <head>eat</head> and every drink you consume . Add these amounts together and then divide the total by 7 .  This will give you your average daily calorie intake .

One of his students at Simmons was the daughter of Frank Francis ,  Director of the British Museum ,  and this led to close contacts with the printing and publishing world in Britain .

But though the camera may be at gut level ,  a cerebral decision has placed it there ,  and it is characteristic of Greenaway that he should stylise a major element of his film in this way .  For this most unspontaneous of artists ,  it is better to have a bad reason for something  a tenuous or cabbalistic reason  than to depend on chance ,  subjectivity and the moment .  Of course , only a sensibility that is accustomed to seeing food largely in still lifes can be surprised , as Greenaway seems to be , by the revelation that food , whether <head>eaten</head> or not , eventually by digestion or rot comes to look less good . This is a particular case of a general rule about Greenaway 's  films :  that only a person as obsessionally preoccupied with formal patterns as the director  and that is a tall order  can properly share his shock when death turns out not to be deterred by lists and games after all .  More moderate temperaments ,  to whom the patterning seemed a sort of death in the first place ,  are apt to remain stubbornly cheerful .

We are continuing to lobby for full compensation for the commercial value of hens slaughtered and for equivalent testing legislation to be introduced throughout the European Community .

The challenge now for the egg industry is to communicate this message to consumers ;  to look forward to the 1990s with confidence in the knowledge that its product is the best in the world  not to waste time and money on the constant examination of its collective navel and on cries of not fair .  Assuming the Daventry nuns have been subject only to the same controls being applied to all other British egg producers ,  the protest by the United Kingdom Egg Producers '  Association  ( Ukepra )  ,  the only organisation within the UK egg industry not represented among BEIC members ,  is potentially damaging both to egg consumers and to egg producers .

Bolshevik sources reveal that about half the population of the guberniia did not have enough to eat by then ,  and the position was no better by spring  of 1922 .

The economic plight of the Volga peasantry was even more crippling than that of the Tambov or Ukrainian population .

The fourth characteristic of each of the three countries is that they have had the luck to avoid the worst of the droughts which have badly affected agriculture and hydro - electric power supplies in many African countries in the 1970s and 1980s .  While the north of Cameroun has been badly affected ,  its key productive areas lie in the high rainfall zones of the western highlands ;  in Kenya the old colonial rule - of - thumb that one year in five will be a year of drought has been sustained ,  and lean years have been followed by bumper crops .  In Botswana , the negative effects of low rainfall years are offset by the consequent increased sale of livestock , much of which is exported to high - value EC markets , since Botswana 's urban meat - <head>eating</head> population is small . Do these three relatively successful countries provide any kind of signpost to the rest of Africa ?  The answer can be only a muted yes since the economic foundations of most African countries ,  and the size and distribution of their population is very different to the situation prevailing in the early 1960s .

On one level ,  it did not prevent some respondents expressing disparaging remarks about Catholics ,  nor dissuade them from giving opinions on controversial political issues .  On a deeper level ,  however ,  as we shall see in later chapters ,  the identity category Catholic is ,  for the majority of policemen and women ,  not an all - inclusive typification in which every Catholic is categorized alike .  Most members of the RUC we <head>encountered</head> used an interpretative process which contains a set of typifications for distinguishing between good and bad Catholics , as for good and bad people generally . Once the field - worker was categorized as conforming to their typification of a good Catholic  ( the meaning of which we will outline elsewhere )  ,  then her religion was no longer as important as it appears at first sight ,  although the extent to which it had a residual effect is impossible to estimate .

It would have been more accurate to say that all policemen and women should have such a role ,  for unfortunately many do not  ( see Trojanowicz and Pollard 1986 )  .  It was an attitude like this which made the individual transfer to community relations in the first place ,  as all those in Easton 's  Community Relations Unit did ,  one even from the Traffic Branch .  This self - selection process ensures that the Community Relations Branch attracts people with enthusiasm and the necessary personal qualities which make them enjoy work with youngsters , and not one member of the Community Relations Branch we <head>encountered</head> in Easton and elsewhere expressed anything other than pleasure and enjoyment from working with youngsters . Such enthusiasm makes them appear eccentric compared to policemen and women on the sections .  The marginality they experience within the force might lead them to exaggerate their job satisfaction ,  but this cuts both ways ,  for the unpopularity of community relations among many ordinary members of the RUC guarantees it will not appeal to any but the committed ,  and section duties already afford the work - shy many opportunities to hide .

Doisneau was born on April 14 ,  1912 in the Parisian suburb of Centilly ,  a town which is far less picturesque than its name suggests .

The son of a working - class family ,  Doisneau developed an early interest in art and was apprenticed as an engraver for a time before he escaped to work for the sculptor and photographer ,  Andre Vigneau .  He encouraged his young assistant to study photographic technique in the manner of the great perfectionist ,  Edward Weston ,  and he also passed on an appreciation of the beauty of everyday objects .

Keats placed him among the stars ,  where Keats himself ,  for similar reasons ,  was to be placed by Shelley .

Readers can be <head>expected</head> to spot which of these quotations are forgeries , and they must also have doubted in their time whether this writer was as good as the early tributes made out . It seems clear ,  however ,  that Chatterton needn't have had prodigious talent for the talent expended in the novel to take effect .  It is a novel which communicates the notion that talented and untalented meet in that country of the mind where everyone copies and steals from everyone else ,  where everything is reproductive or reminiscent of everything else ,  where one thing leads to another and this person passes into that .

The computer system will only bring the returns that the company <head>expects</head> if the people using it are using the system fully , which can be guaranteed through investment in adequate training . It must also be noted that the computer systems generate information and it is how this information is used that influences the returns on the total package .

It is normal for this sensitivity to remain for a few flights and then gradually to disappear .  After a little more flying experience ,  beginners '  eyes interpret what is happening to the aircraft and the alarm signal is no longer sent on to the brain .  For example , as the stick is moved forwards a little , the eyes see the nose of the glider moving down , and the brain <head>expects</head> the sensation and understands what is happening . As there is no cause for alarm ,  the brain suppresses the sensation at source .

.  Again Douglas  ( 1966 :  138 )  has suggested there is a liaison which exists between the physical body and its use as an expression of the social ,  so that one becomes a paradigm for the other :  the human body is a model which can stand for any bounded system .  It should come as no surprise ,  therefore ,  to find that a well - disciplined human body with clearly defined parameters of correctness will provide a symbolic mirror of the  preferred police social formation in which the human condition can be enacted .  We can also <head>expect</head> to find that any discrepancy in this preferred social formation will be reflected and transferred to the physical body as a metaphor of chaos . These adjacent police forces were physically aberrant in nuance of bodily style and were therefore deemed to be socially incorrect .  In their metaphorical indiscipline they had gained new status and slipped across a boundary into marginality ,  for as Foucault  ( 1977 :  25 )  has suggested ,  the idea of discipline revolves around control of the physical body and proceeds from the distribution of individuals in space it is always the body that is at issue  the body and its forces ,  their utility and their docility ,  their distribution and their punishment .

The other emerges when he remarks in the opening lines the regular yet halting rhythm ,  the smooth uncertainty of movement which may either proceed to greater regularity or fall away into improvisation .  This perception is picked up later ,  more than once ,  as Tate moves through the poem :  subtly and imperceptibly the rhythm has changed ,  there is constant and sudden change of rhythm ,  a broken and distracted rhythm .  If we read Ash - Wednesday through with Tate 's commentary at our elbow , we see at any given point what he means : he has a good ear , as we might <head>expect</head> from his own poems ( which are however metrical , as Ash - Wednesday is n't ) . And we may agree that what binds together the six parts of Ash - Wednesday is in large part something rhythmical .  It remains true that in Tate 's  criticism and since  ( for no advance has been made in this quarter )  rhythm and movement are wholly impressionistic  you hear what the critic is talking about ,  or else you do n't .

More and more the struggle to <head>express</head> it intensified . Matisse and all the others saw the twentieth century with their eyes but they saw the reality of the nineteenth century ,  Picasso was the only one in painting who saw the twentieth century with his eyes and saw its reality and consequently his struggle was terrifying ,  terrifying for himself and for the others ,  because he had nothing to help him ,  the past did not help him ,  nor the present ,  he had to do it all alone and ,  in spite of much strength he is often very weak ,  he consoled himself and allowed himself to be seduced by other things which led him more or less astray .

The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 .  There was one vital breakthrough for the nationalist consciousness ,  though there still remains some doubt as to how deep this was for the Fianna Fil party :  all the parties committed themselves to the recognition of the protestant  loyalist group as having legitimate aspirations and affirmed the need for the recognition of two sets of legitimate rights coexisting in the island as a whole :  Constitutional nationalists are determined to secure justice for all traditions The new Ireland must be a society within which , subject only to public order , all cultural , political and religious beliefs can be freely <head>expressed</head> and practised . This was made explicit in terms of the sense of British identity which protestant loyalists experience :  This implies in particular ,  in respect of Northern protestants ,  that the civil and religious liberties that they uphold and enjoy will be fully protected and their sense of Britishness accommodated  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  223 )  .  For the very first time ,  the leadership of all the major constitutional nationalist parties in Ireland ,  representing 90 per cent of the nationalist population ,  had abandoned the concept of the tyranny of the majority will .

The structural invisibility enjoyed by the uniform wearer is a strange matter to experience .  You become a symbol with no personal identity beyond the small ,  specific numeral on the shoulder .

Like other symbolic non - verbal devices ,  the multi - vocal nuances of our uniform were used in a variety of other ways as boundary markers to maintain our cultural identity and define our institutional specificities .  Just as the white - coated doctors in hospitals symbolize the clean and purifying nature of the healer ,  so the dark uniform of the police symbolizes not just the force identity ,  but also the presence of the avenger ,  who purifies through retribution rather than by cure .

That passionate love of music as movement is what Rachmaninov 's  Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini  is all about .

In composing the Rhapsody  ,  Rachmaninov tried to vary the Paganini theme as much as  possible by differentiating the instrumental sections one from another .  Whereas Symphonic Variations  flows onwards in simple serenity ,  Ashton ,  following Rachmaninov ,  here uses an enormous variety of steps and constantly changes the choreographic phrasing to reflect the increasing or diminishing sounds and to match the tempi of the melody ,  in order to give his enchanements  light and shade and to indicate the sheer complexity of the orchestration .

With regard to the debate about c  and Doppler shifts in the letters pages ,  light  ( velocity c  )  reflected or emitted from a surface moving with velocity v  towards an observer appears to be blue shifted ,  or red shifted in the case of a receding surface .  As a non - physicist I have often wondered if the difference in photon energy  (  E '  E = hf '  hf  )  of the shifted and unshifted light could be wholly accounted for by the effect of the surface velocity  (  v  )  acting together with the particle equivalent mass of the photon .  The extra energy not being allowed to be <head>expressed</head> as an increase in c appears as a commensurate increase in f , that is : ( formula included ) where m is the photon equivalent mass ( yes I know it is related to E but I am trying not to confuse myself ) , E is the energy , and h is Mr Plank 's claim to fame .

This is the inarticulate prayer that is answered  ( we read in Philippians )  in the resurrection ,  the redemption of all human suffering ,  of all mortality .  The prayer of Jesus from the heart of the suffering world is not something in the mind ,  it is his accepted bodily agony and it is by being given the grace to accept our material weakness and pain and finally our death in union with him that we too can pray .  That is why the prayer of the Church as such , the Eucharistic meal which <head>expresses</head> and celebrates joyfully the community of the Church and the ultimate unity of humankind is the sacrament of bodily suffering , of the sacrificial death of Christ at our hands .

Nor is the idea of community policing popular amongst ordinary constables in other sections of the police ,  often because it contradicts their views of what constitutes real police work ,  but also because they have misguided notions about what community policing is ,  as well as a practical awareness of the unrealistic expectations held of it by enthusiasts .

She seems to revel in arguments and loses no opportunity to declare her political principles .

Sir Ian Gilmour ,  a member of Mrs Thatcher 's  Cabinet until his dismissal in 1981 ,  has been the most articulate critic of the new Conservatism .  His views have been <head>expressed</head> in numerous speeches and newspaper articles and in two learned and witty books , Inside Right and Britain Can Work . He claims that Conservatism is not an idea ,  still less is it a system of ideas and that the Conservative tradition is marked by scepticism ,  a sense of the limitations of human reason ,  a rejection of abstraction or abstract doctrines ,  a distrust of systems and a belief in the importance of experience and circumstances .  He invokes Burke in his opposition to a priori politics and to the application of systematic and abstract schemes and policies .

Many of Charles 's  ideas sprang from a memorable visit to Boston in September 1986 ,  when he had been invited to speak at the Harvard 350th Commemoration Ceremony .  It was an opportunity to talk about education and America ,  an irresistible combination as far as he was concerned ,  for which he happily interrupted his holiday at Balmoral .  There was no pool of academics or professionals contributing to this talk ; it was a speech very much from the heart , and the thoughts <head>expressed</head> mocked by the tabloids , needless to say , as philosophical ramblings are still very relevant today .

For a start ,  did n't Mrs Thatcher have some justification for concluding that Mr Lawson had deliberately chosen the Walters row as an excuse for abandoning ship ?  Certainly his resignation ensures that he will be in the clear when the economic roof falls in  an event which many people now regard as virtually inevitable .  The second aspect is the extent to which recent events prove that politicians should avoid <head>expressing</head> the obvious , because it always leads to trouble . Take ,  for instance ,  the brouhaha which has followed Mrs Thatcher 's  hint that she will probably retire sometime between the next general election and the one after that .  This was made the payoff in the Sunday Correspondent 's  interview with the PM ,  though it has since emerged that the sequence of the conversation was altered .

This is why the CIA during the 50s and 60s covertly supported a multitude of initiatives whose aim was to present the new American Art across the world as a promise for the future .  Since the works  ( de Kooning apart )  were abstract they lent themselves to diverse interpretations .  In this way a mostly desperate body of art , which had at first shocked the American public , was transformed by speeches , articles and the context in which it was displayed , into an ideological weapon for the defence of Individualism and the right to <head>express</head> oneself . Pollock ,  I 'm sure ,  was unaware of this programme  he died too soon ;  nevertheless the propaganda apparatus helped to create the confusion surrounding his art after his death .

Ralph strives to address the high heid yins of Russia to solicit news of the family ,  and receives his letter back from the Embassy in London ,  stamped :  Communication not permitted .

Meaning of course that the 51st had landed in Normandy several days after D - Day morning .  The Highlanders were very generous ,  not only with their bagpipe reeds but also with their wee drams .

There was also a touch of home  one of the Highlanders produced a few newspaper cuttings from the British Press .

But it is not just bad weather which takes the gilt off the packed - lunch gingerbread .  On those rare days when the weather has run out of rain and the sun has driven away the clouds ,  the wrong packed lunch can be just as disastrous .  When the morning walk has been a <head>hot</head> , hard climb and all breathing has been in gasps , you can arrive at lunchtime with a mouth as dry as a salt mine . You have probably been perspiring quite impressively too ,  and you are beginning to have fantasies of pints of a cool drink .  You fall with relief upon your packed lunch mystery parcel  and what do you find ?

The <head>hot</head> , dry weather was beginning to break , to be replaced by ferocious winds which seemed determined to pluck us off the mountainside .

It stands as a sympathetic appraisal by a critic who is trusting largely to his own intuitive sense of quality :  He wants to suggest the exclusive nature of that subliminal world  to dwell there ,  and to forget the conscious world .

This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .  Again , much interest attaches to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical <head>image</head> of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure . The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs  to be considered as devotional imagery ,  and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .

Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of image - making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is .  In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The <head>images</head> carry different information . The physical make - up of dots in a photograph differs from the lines and granular surface of the aquatint ;  the aquatint 's  variations describe the picture more eloquently .  The art of civilisations other than that of the West are now more readily visible through photography ,  and within the limitations of the medium ,  usefully so .

The broader tradition is a typically nationalist one ,  seeing national liberation through war as honourable and singularly justified .  To a degree it is widespread among many not just in the provisional movement but also in the Fianna Fil party ,  and in general among those who see their history as one of liberation through blood .  The statue in the market square at Dundalk , a Provisional Sinn Fein memorial , of the Irish liberator rising up behind the phoenix , is an <head>image</head> with much wider appeal . The Easter rising of 1916 as an act of national liberation ,  unquestioned in the dominant catholic  nationalist culture from 1922 until well into the 1960s and 1970s ,  still holds a cherished place in the hearts of the majority of the people .  It is possible for such sentiments of approval of this past to coexist with abhorrence for most current acts of violence .

That is the emphatic point ;  the tone of the book ,  its whole direction ,  is thereby established .  Mandel is right about its being unified powerfully ,  but the principle of unity centres on freedom ,  not the Sabbath ceremonies  ( intrinsic ,  as they are ,  to Leonard 's  conception of freedom )  ;  which merely protects   ( when allowed to do so )  that freedom .

Hume described Berkeley 's  attack on abstract ideas as the most important development of late in the republic of letters .  The purport of that attack was to prove that generality could never be an intrinsic property of a mental content .  Berkeley 's reason for thinking this was that he believed mental contents to be mental images , and there cannot be a general <head>image</head> . It never seemed to occur to him that a general idea might be an entirely different sort of thing from an image .  Ideas ,  according to Berkeley ,  are particulars whose significance is explained by saying that they stand for  the things they represent .

It is tempting to think of it as a felt  tendency ,  so that one is somehow aware of where the mind is going .  This will not do ,  for it is no different from saying that when one experiences red one thinks or conceives of the colour ,  whereas the point of the theory was to explain what such thinking ,  or conceiving ,  is .  It is similarly tempting to think of the colour <head>image</head> as hovering in the background , somehow anticipated by the mind ; but this is a metaphor , for the image either is or is not in consciousness . And ,  contrary to Hume 's  contention ,  being very dimly  in consciousness is not the same as being thought of .  The tendency of the mind to move from one thing to another has to consist in the straightforward fact that one thing usually follows ,  or is caused by ,  the other ;  the tendency or association cannot be thought of as some experienced  feature of the situation without reviving the original situation of having an unanalysed conception of the mind 's  ability to reach out and apprehend things .

This aid money  worth US1 billion per annum  is crucial to the fulfilment of the government 's  economic policies .  There have been some events which give qualified cause for optimism .  Perhaps most <head>important</head> is the development of a Mothers Front to campaign for investigations into the mass disappearances .

Although headed by opposition MPs ,  it has grown independently on a national basis and held its first large scale rally in Colombo in late February 1991 .

He earned this disputable title by his thoughtful approach to critical issues and the undeniable distinction of his critical practice .  His writings on art include several reviews of the Paris Salons ,  which were either published in booklets or in journals such as the Revue franaise  .  The custom of writing about the Salons was well established , and had inspired brilliant writing by such an <head>important</head> figure in the eighteenth century as Diderot . By the 1850s the tradition had declined ,  so that Baudelaire was seeking to give new life to a decayed literary genre .

One view of the art market is that it is like a staircase with several landings .  Only dealers sell on the steps ,  while private owners prefer the more certain floor of a landing of clearly established prices for a category of work .  Correct descriptions are <head>important</head> to auctioneers , as can be exemplified by the coding used to list paintings . This is the system used by Sothebys :  ( a )  references to signatures ,  inscription and dates refer to the present state of the work ;    ( b )  the term bears a signature and/or date and/or inscription means that in our opinion the artist 's  name and/or date and/or inscription have been added by another hand ;   ( c )  the term signed and/or dated and/or inscribed means that in our opinion the signature and/or date and/or inscription are from the hand of the artist .

Cultural history and theory ,  it has to be said ,  have very extensive agenda ,  and art criticism is perhaps only a sub - paragraph under a secondary heading .

Articles of synthesis between art and other subjects may include <head>important</head> art criticism . Literary theory is at present in demand as a point of reference for writing on the visual arts .  Articles on this sort of theme may appear in art periodicals ,  but are just as likely to be found in other  journals ,  on literature ,  say ,  or history .

There will always be problems when working with an English vernacular text using cockney or other dialects ,  but students from overseas have to expect to take this in their stride  ( and usually do )  .  Undoubtedly one of the best ways the overseas student has of seeing what is required in British theatre training is to apply for one of the summer schools offered by the drama schools ,  and find out what it 's  all about before committing him -  or herself to a long and expensive stay .  It 's <head>important</head> that a student is prepared to understand and work with the prevalent theatrical traditions in UK schools . And with so much theatre training available in the United States ,  New Zealand ,  Australia and Canada ,  it is interesting to ask why  British theatre training is thought to be so beneficial .  I can only put it down to the strong classical emphasis which prevails in the courses offered in the UK ,  although many of the university drama courses in the USA do stage Shakespeare and the European classical authors .

Art history without names was a phrase used by Heinrich Wlflinn ,  in his introduction to The Principles of Art History  first published in 1915 .  Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's  successor as professor at Basel ,  but his later successful career took him to Berlin ,  Munich and Zrich ,  a major art historian whose interests were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque .  Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant of artists , but the famous phrase indicated an <head>interest</head> in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition . Wlflinn 's  writings are strong on observation ;  this can be understood from his choice of terms to describe tendencies in form ;  linear as against painterly ,  plane surface as against recessional depth ,  closed against open form ,  composite clarity against fused clarity ,  or absolute clarity against relative clarity .  Such polarities were evidently valuable aids to several generations of Wlflinn 's  pupils who could benefit from his personal teaching as well as the rather more rigid theory in his books .

This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .  Again , much <head>interest</head> attaches to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure . The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have difficulty in deciding how far the picture needs  to be considered as devotional imagery ,  and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits .

Reading plays is an essential part of your career preparation  the more plays you read the more you will understand of the  theatre 's  development .  Academic study of drama as such is not necessarily useful for the actor ,  but an awareness of playwrights and their various styles is  of practical value .  A play is primary a piece of action and although a script contains some scenic and character description , the essential <head>interest</head> lies in the dialogue and the action arising from it . A play really demands to be read aloud  - it needs the sound of the human voice to bring it alive .

Also ,  there can be no doubt that the South would intervene in the North on behalf of the catholic  nationalist minority if Britain withdrew and civil war broke out .  Equally ,  Southern catholic nationalists prefer a unified Irish state ,  though a majority of 54 per cent would accept a federal one based on the present two state units .  One can therefore conclude that there is a sense of unity throughout the catholic nationalist population as a whole , though one in which certain groups , namely farming <head>interests</head> and the church , at both clerical and popular levels , have strategically dominated , at least until recently . By 1914 ,  the protestant  loyalist group was well established and ready for war against catholic nationalists should it have proven necessary .  Issues of class conflict within the group were to remain largely subordinate ,  as the matter of the nature and defence of loyalism itself was to dominate the scene right down to the present day .

It proved to be a period of strained relations with the English liberals ,  who were allies of the Irish party ,  but who were also in favour of bringing schooling more and more under state rather than church control  ( Miller 1973 :  817 ,  12038 ,  26892 )  .  By this time ,  the schools frequented by Roman catholics in Ireland were also largely under the direct control of the church 's  clerics .  But secularizing moves by the English liberals over the Education Bills of 1902 , 1906 , and a private member 's Bill of 1911 led the Irish hierarchy to question some of the political intentions of the Irish politicians , who it was feared might sell out the church 's <head>interest</head> in schools . According to the Liberal - Irish alliance ,  the Irish party was supposed to abstain from the 1901 Conservative bill ,  aimed at bringing denominational schools in England and Wales into the national education system while at the same time absenting them from local government control :  that is ,  giving finance while maintaining the system of denominational clerical control .  With the Irish party abstaining ,  both English and Irish Roman catholic bishops began to pressurize the leader of the Irish party ,  Redmond ,  and his associates to support the Conservative bill .

MacCabe and Heath had studied in Paris ,  and Signs of the Times  has its niche in postwar cultural history ,  marking the first major re - entry of French intellectual influences since Eliot 's  adherence to Remy de Gourmont and the French neoclassicists ,  half a century earlier .  For the sake of convenience I shall apply the term la nouvelle critique  to the complex  of ideas emerging from the Paris of the 1960s ,  including many diverse strands :  the classical structuralism of the early Barthes ,  the poststructuralism of his later work ,  the deconstructionism of Derrida ,  and whatever name one gives to the work of Foucault and Lacan ,  in taxonomic historiography and dissident psychoanalysis respectively .  Frank Kermode was the first senior academic in English studies to take a sympathetic <head>interest</head> in la nouvelle critique , particularly its analysis of narrative .

The enthusiasm has ,  of course ,  been exploited ,  in the opportunistic launching of courses in women 's  studies ,  and by the publishing industry which has filled the shelves of bookshops  general as well as academic  with books with women in their titles .  One of the most interesting and welcome results of literary feminism has been the reprinting of forgotten texts ,  usually by women but occasionally by men .  In an earlier Chapter I argued that the canon is bursting , because of the advent of other anglophone literatures , and the increasing <head>interest</head> in contemporary writing . Undoubtedly ,  the new availability of earlier texts of feminist interest is helping the explosion .  At the same time ,  at the level of practical pedagogy ,  there is a counter - tendency in the study of the national canon to concentrate more and more on a small and diminishing number of texts .

Thus ,  The Tempest  is about colonialism ;  not only The taming of the Shrew  but King Lear  and Measure for Measure  are a focus for feminist readings ;  while Henry V  encodes a contemporary Elizabethan colonialist endeavour ,  the fantasy of a successful Irish campaign .  These readings are intermittently illuminating ,  if reductive ,  and basically they are doing what criticism has always done ,  which is to interpret the works of the past in the terms and concepts of the critic 's  own age .  It is precisely this capacity for renewed interpretation that makes literature of more than simply historical <head>interest</head> . Latterday Marxist interpreters of Shakespeare are doing much the same as the conservative proponents of the Elizabethan World Picture did thirty or forty years ago ,  though with a different  conceptual model .

This current feeling for the past might provide a way in adult classes of shifting the emphasis from popular modern writing to earlier literature .  Chaucer looked at in isolation can seem daunting ,  but Chaucer read in a cultural and historical context ,  with visual and other aids ,  could come alive as a great poet ,  speaking across six centuries ,  in a Gadamerian fusion of horizons .

This is a speculative proposal ,  merely ,  and it may fall foul of the fact  that in our image - ridden culture reading is difficult ,  and literary texts still demand to be read  ,  rigorously and carefully .

Aphrodite 's  lie about a non - existent human father ,  King Otreus ,  of Phrygia ,  is designed to conceal her divinity from her human mate ,  who is applauded for seeing through the fiction because of something uncanny in his bed - mate 's  bearing  sometimes specified as her gait ,  her way of walking .

In many of them ,  particularly criminal cases ,  the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the public .  In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as ,  for example ,  that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands .  In the second category , general civil cases , parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the <head>interests</head> of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's right of choice . Lord Donaldson implied ,  however ,  that solicitors who exercised their new rights of audience in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy .  While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions ,  Lord Donaldson 's  voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .

Robin Cook ,  a member of the national executive and the health spokesman ,  said that a Labour government which sought to force its programme on an unwilling nation would be unsocialist .  He told a Labour Co - ordinating Committee rally that it was not enough for Labour to win the next election .  It would also be necessary to smash the decrepit , effete constitution that allows a minority to capture power , and then use it ruthlessly in the <head>interests</head> of the privileged few . Mr Cook argued that 10 years of Thatcherism had been forced on most people ,  who had never voted Conservative ,  and that many of those who opposed PR in the Labour Party wanted to use the same undemocratic power to ram socialism down the throats of a majority who did n't vote for it .  Advocates of the first - past - the - post system argued that it was the only way of delivering strong government ,  Mr Cook said .

It is an accepted practice in dire situations such as this that the board is replaced or supplemented by a new board charged with the function of restoring the fortunes of the company and the confidence of customers ,  the letter says .  You may care to consider whether this is not a practice to be followed in the case of Ferranti .

Britain has been muttering that if it perceives a consensus for democracy in Hong Kong ,  it will start talking tough to Peking at a diplomatic level ,  and perhaps even adopt the Legislative Council proposals for 1995 in the teeth of Chinese opposition and without regard to convergence with the Basic Law .  If so ,  it will come to the negotiating table severely handicapped by its past history of deference :  it could as easily have confronted the issue four years ago ,  when it would have stood more of a chance of winning .  It would also now risk being seen to act as much in the <head>interests</head> of its own credibility , as in support of a sincerely - held belief . Another post - Tiananmen worry ,  greater for for Hong Kong than for any other interested party ,  must be the future of China 's  economy and economic policies .

So long as there is a full right of appeal against a refusal of leave  a right which the present Government sought ,  at one stage ,  to abolish  this handicap is acceptable ,  even though it places public authorities in a more privileged position than the ordinary litigant .

It is in the public <head>interest</head> for challenges to the exercise of public powers to be made promptly , so that the administration and citizens alike know what the law is . But it is unjust that the individual 's  right of access to the courts should be restricted solely on the ground that there has been delay in making the application .  As the Law Commission recommended in 1976 ,  the test should be whether the granting of relief to an applicant who has delayed would cause substantial prejudice or hardship to any person or would be detrimental to good administration .

In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main sources of the bishops '  opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation .  That the bishops were affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme clearly they stood to <head>lose</head> money and independence if such a scheme were implemented seems likely . Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used ,  the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .

Throughout Ireland as a whole ,  there has generally been an anti - comprehensive ethos in the education system supportive of both class and sectarian divisions in schooling and which is now eroding only in part .  In Northern Ireland ,  the catholic schools '  sector is provided for out of state funds ,  and remains under the governorship of the local clergy ,  now assisted by laity and members of the local educational and library boards .  Many Roman catholic schools up to 1968 were financed for capital expenditure by the local church as part of the church 's determination not to <head>lose</head> control of them . The chairman of the board is usually the parish priest or his curate .  With the exception of a small group of public schools ,  there is the apparently simple distinction between state schools and Roman catholic schools which occurs in Britain .

New actors need to try and widen their range all the time and in the same breath find a way of being  commercially as well as artistically viable .

I <head>mean</head> the most exciting moment of all is when you are actually chosen for a part after that initial excitement it 's a bit downhill not because the work is n't marvellous but because the first challenge is the peak . I think everyone needs the director to be vitally interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual performance .  In the West End there seems at the moment a tendency to rely too much on the goodwill of actors which is often accompanied by a failure to maintain a true interest in what is going on for the actor .

The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s .  It should be added here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type .  Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate , they <head>meant</head> they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state . But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation .  In addition ,  the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships ,  doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .

But that <head>misses</head> the point , if theory can be identified with literature .

Admittedly ,  conditions in the American academy are a little tighter than they once were ,  but what looks like stringency by American standards is still lavishness by British ones .

Tony Gordon 's  Kiwis ,  who will now find it difficult to go through the remainder of their tour undefeated ,  are not as tight and efficient a force as Graham Lowe 's  team of four years ago ,  but with a virtual Test side out ,  should have been far too strong for Murphy 's  collection of reserves .  That Saints managed to cause an upset with nothing more than direct running and honest endeavour ,  bodes well for Great Britain ,  though the Kiwis cannot be expected to enter the Test arena in such a generous mood .

Andrew Harrison <head>missed</head> a straightforward chance from 25 metres . He missed with two other attempts ,  one from longer range and a sitter from 20 metres ,  failing to reward the efforts of his pack ,  who were considerably outweighed by the Lancashire eight .  Cumbria threatened to fall apart when they lost their hooker ,  Derek Dougan ,  just before the interval ,  as Lancashire 's  Mark Hesketh finished off a surge by Shaun Gallagher ,  initiated by the lively Dewi Morris ,  to give Lancashire a 9 - 0 lead at the break.

As Albert Elsen has <head>noted</head> : We know that with major sculptures such as The Burghers of Calais  and the Balzac  ,  Rodin did not claim that they were equally successful from all points of view .

From its domination by the old ascendancy ,  the Orange order in particular came to embrace protestants from all classes and churches .  In fact ,  in rural areas today ,  the Orange hall has frequently been the only place where protestants of all shades have met to renew their belief and commitment to Ulster protestant loyalism  ( Harris 1972 :  1625 )  .  It is important to <head>note</head> that these organizations are internally stratified . Those nearer the top ,  particularly in the Black Preceptory ,  the inner sanctum of the society structure ,  are there because of their moral and religious standing in the local community :  wealthy farmers ,  businessmen ,  good churchmen ,  or at least of known moral probity .  They tend to represent the religious as opposed to the rough end of the protestant spiritual spectrum .

In parallel with the Republic ,  class politics has flourished even less on the protestant  loyalist side ,  despite the periodic strength of protestant trade unionism  ( Patterson 1980 )  .  There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ;  but it had been based on industrial workers ,  particularly in the shipyards ,  and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart .  As Gibbon has <head>noted</head> , the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles ( 1975 : 3 ) . The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions .  By providing core beliefs ,  and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances ,  religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions ,  become embroiled in cementing alliances ,  and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

Religious education in these schools is officially non - denominational or biblically based and loyalist sentiments are promoted .  But religious education has been known to be fundamentalist and in some cases anti - catholic ,  depending on the teacher .  It is important to <head>note</head> that , since the system began in the late 1920s , there has never been a significant move to split up the schools for use by the separate denominations , something which would have been feasible in the larger towns . The Northern public - sector schools come from the partly voluntary system of pre - Partition .  In 1928 ,  these schools entered the system of maintained schools ,  whereby ,  in exchange for full payment of current costs and 65 per cent of capital expenditure ,  the former owners and managers ,  usually churches ,  were allowed two - thirds representation  on the local board of management ,  with the other third coming from the local authority .

It is an often - repeated truism to say that the institution of the pub is unique to Britain  but it is still one which is well worth resurrecting .  It is also a fairly obvious statement to say that historic pubs have served the function well for hundreds of years .  As Alan Crawford <head>noted</head> in the SAVE/CAMRA report Time Gentlemen Please of 1983 , old pubs are not isolated or monumental , but part of the fabric of the city , and of people 's ordinary lives , street - corner history . They are not arcane but easily enjoyable .  They are not inaccessible but quite the reverse ,  and they have their original working use still .

Disregard for the individual qualities of pub interiors can be fatal .  A pub ,  like any other old building ,  is far more than just its principle facade ,  or its four walls .  As Neil Richardson <head>noted</head> in 1980 , An old town pub is not just an attractive Victorian or Georgian facade , it is a building which is still being used for the purpose for which it was built . The design of interiors are as valid today as they were in earlier times  the vaults ,  snugs ,  parlours ,  each with their own character ,  can still provide a pleasant ,  varied atmosphere .  However ,  to public and professionals alike many old buildings are still regarded as representing little more than four external walls .

Countless other pubs which date from the Georgian period ,  or at least incorporate a significant element of Georgian building work ,  have suffered similar fates .  National brewing giants such as Allied or Whitbread ,  though ,  are not the only villains ;  small independent firms can be just as insensitive in their treatment of their tied houses .  Claire Hunt , for instance , <head>noted</head> in 1988 of North Western brewers Robinsons that they appear on the whole to be fairly oblivious to the individual merits of their historic pubs . One key problem with the more domestically - scaled Georgian pubs is that they were often originally conceived as ,  or converted from ,  modest homes .  The numerous internal partitions that result have often proved anathema to modern - day breweries .

One of the most successful ways of giving a different quality to the steps and poses of classical dance and of transforming them into demi - caractre  style is to relate them intimately to appropriate music .  Every country has its own way of performing the traditional dances which go hand in hand with certain musical characteristics .  Choreographers should <head>note</head> the particular relationships between steps and notes , enchanements and phrases and how strong or weak beats affect the rhythm . They cannot be too strict about this relationship ,  for the score ,  whether commissioned or arranged ,  will only give some flavour of the traditional ways of singing and dancing .  This can be easily recognised if Bizet 's  music for Carmen  is compared with De Falla 's  fur The Three - Cornered Hat  .

A further consideration about feminist criticism ,  is that it is more practical than theoretical ,  in a familiar English way ,  and that unlike other schools in the rainbow coalition ,  it is actively concerned in producing readings of particular texts .  Most of them are produced by women ,  who provide insights that come from relating female experience to a body of writing ;  logically ,  there is no reason why these insights should not be available to male critics with the right sympathies and sensibility ,  but in practice most of this criticism is by women .  Such criticism , it is worth <head>noting</head> , is basically mimetic ; literature is assumed to relate to experience . Feminist criticism ,  like Marxist ,  is avowedly evaluative ,  which sharply distinguishes it from the generality of current academic criticism ,  of whatever school .  This is desirable in itself ,  though I do not warm to the feminist MacCarthyism which subjects texts to a close ,  hostile interrogation in a search for sexist attitudes .

He was the one with the distant ,  distracted look and the voice which sounded as though it were the product of an experiment by Dr Timothy Leary .

It is a consistent piece ,  full of melodies that quickly start to nag ,  expensive arrangements and above it all McCulloch 's  ingenuous ,  whispering ,  conspiratorial voice .  Horse 's  Head  ( a Godfather of a track )  ,  The Flickering Wall and the title track should provide acid fans with as big a fix as they will need until the next Wonder Stuff album .

Now suffering ,  in the proper sense ,  is caused precisely by external factors affecting us ,  physical conditions or the actions of other human beings which afflict or constrain us .

Belief in the impassibility of God , it is worth <head>noting</head> , was developed in the early Christian centuries against the background of popular religious belief in the world of that day , where gods were no more than human beings on a large scale , subject to the same contingencies , passions , frustrations and feelings of pain or pleasure that determine human nature .

The Attlee government in some ways is a final commentary on the deep - rooted strength of this faith in the institutions of the state .  The partial reaction against it in the Tory 1950s  setting the people free  did not lead to the contraction of the government service .  On the contrary , as Professor Northcote Parkinson <head>noted</head> at the time , the civil service expanded as never before , locally as well as nationally , and the prominent place of central - government expenditure ( consistently over 40 per cent as a proportion of gross national product in this period ) is an outstanding feature of the period 195164 . By the time of the Wilson government in 1964 ,  it was clear that the old confidence in governmental planning was ,  for a variety of reasons ,  in some disarray .  In part ,  it was part of a wider decline in the authority of national institutions from the monarchy to the police ;  satire and culture criticism reflected the process and took it further .

The failure to reverse the spending growth was a disappointing outcome for the advocates of cuts in the many bruising Cabinet battles over public spending between 1979 and 1982 .  There have been marked shifts in spending between programmes since 1979 .  It is worth <head>noting</head> , however , that the spending priorities have not been radically dissimilar from those planned by the outgoing Labour government , which also planned for cuts in spending on education and housing and an expansion in spending on defence , law and order , and social security . Table 8 .  1 above shows that between 1978  9 and 1988  9 there was a major and planned increase in real terms in spending on defence and law and order ;  spending on housing and industry were heavily cut ,  while on education  ( helped by a fall in numbers of school children )  and on transport it stayed fairly constant .  For all the concern over the level of public spending the British share as a proportion of GDP in 1979 was only at the mid - point of most western states .

In economic policy ,  of course ,  this autonomy of government had been further compromised by Mr Heath 's  search for agreement with the trade unions on incomes policy between 1972 and 1974 and by succeeding Labour governments .  The task therefore was to recover greater autonomy at the centre and limit the state 's  obligations to those that were essential and/or that it could carry out .  As already <head>noted</head> , the attraction of monetarism for the new Conservative leadership by 1979 was that it promised a method of controlling inflation by means , as it were , of an automatic pilot ; there would be no need for government to compromise its authority with producer groups . Strict control of the money supply and a curb on government borrowing would squeeze inflation out of the economy .  The government would not print the money to pay for inflationary wage deals .

The next day ,  Beaverbrook  ( who ,  with Amery ,  had been among those who had helped bring down the Lloyd George coalition in 1922 )  strongly urged Amery to work closely with Hailsham both to keep the positive campaign going and decide when the critical moment should come for putting an end to the Coalition .

Disgruntled Conservative agriculturalists and imperialists resented Bonar Law 's  dropping of the food taxes in the winter of 191213 ,  and although he survived the initial furore sparked by this decision it was not clear that the ill feeling had been fully dissipated or his leadership wholly secured .

None the less ,  irrespective of what their position might be ,  modern anthropology would reject the view that the progress of technology is totally irreversible ,  although the sequence of technological progress Marx and Engels took over from their anthropological sources is still ,  by and large ,  acceptable .  The problem with their evolutionary sequence does not lie so much with what they say about technology as what they saw this technology as implying .  Before we examine these problems one important question of method must be <head>noted</head> . Marx and Engels ,  like all their contemporaries ,  including anthropologists and archaeologists and Morgan in particular ,  felt that information gained about contemporary peoples whose life depended on a simple technology was valid for understanding the social institutions of prehistoric populations who had relied on a similar technology .  For example ,  if the Bushmen of the Kalahari ,  who live by hunting and gathering ,  accord a high status to women this ,  it was assumed ,  must also have been true of the hunters and gatherers of prehistoric times .

He also presents us with a fairly strict unilineal theory of evolution ,   ( if we forget about the difference between the New and the Old Worlds )  .  The other area of doubt concerns a question whether the same laws of historical development apply to the whole history of mankind or whether different ,  simpler laws apply to primitive societies .  This , as we have <head>noted</head> , is closely linked to the question whether something like classes have always existed , because the Marxist theory of history centres around the notion of class . If ,  as Engels assumes in The Origin  ,  primitive societies contained no inequality ,  then it would follow ,  according to Marxist thought ,  that a different ,  simpler theory of history would apply for these societies .  If ,  on the other hand ,  something like classes had always existed ,  as assumed in The German Ideology  ,  the first edition of The Communist Manifesto  ,  and Formen  ,  then the principles developed by Marx in Capital  could be made to apply to all societies .

What the protestant loyalists in effect seek to maintain is protestant  loyalist domination within a flexible territory ,  one which they feel justified in calling their land and ruling according to their conscience .

By myth is meant here what has generally come to be accepted within sociology and social anthropology since the work of Levi - Strauss :  an account of the origins of a society or of particular crucial events in its life ,  which unite the cosmos to the social structure by actively shaping everyday life perceptions .  The historical consciousness of Ulster protestants in this sphere is also a  faith consciousness .

It can be quite painful ,  for the insider is studying his own social navel ,  with the potential always present that he will recognize this to be only one of a number of arbitrary possibilities and perhaps also find that many practices are built on the flimsiest of moral precepts .  Such special knowledge holds further difficulties ,  for it highlights the specifically political nature of any ethnographic account  of such an institution ,  bringing to the forefront those expectations of loyalty which the executive demands of any individual who has hold of the account .  Ethical problems will surface , for no power - based <head>organization</head> likes to have its idiosyncrasies made public , and the anthropologist who is a member of the family and not merely a temporary visitor to the backyard exotica can find that writing anything at all becomes crucially problematic . Expectations of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reaching fruition ,  for as the revelations of Spycatcher   ( Wright and Greenglass 1986 )  revealed ,  it is not necessarily what is written which causes the pain ;  rather it is the breach of the convention which requires members in various arms of the executive to say nothing about their practices .  This returns us to Arendt 's  observation that secrecy is a prerequisite of totalitarianism ,  for those involved in the executive use of power know that to reveal is antagonistic to its maintenance .

As Crick  ( 1976 :  123 )  has argued ,  criminology  ( like anthropology )  ,  is largely concerned with systems of classification .  In consequence ,  police modes of thought build up into classifiable systems of praxis which are the product of dealing with the extremes of social experience .  These in turn become massively overdetermined , regenerative and self - justifying , creating an institutional mind which , although allegedly acting on behalf of society and the majority population , comes to regard that same group as outsiders and potential antagonists who are never to be accorded easy access to the processes of the <head>organization</head> . Such a world view is the product of a perception conceptualized to contend dramatically with the instant experience of dealing with highly emotive ,  personal conflicts at street level ,  or the tensions of ritual battles with criminals .  Inevitably in such circumstances ,  the detail of practice suffers a reduction to enable these charged and emotional situations to be handled more easily and to allow the complexities of social events to be reduced to the simplicities of narrative necessary for the file of evidence .

Fforde locates the rise of collectivism in the last quarter of the nineteenth century ,  equates collectivism with socialism ,  and views collectivism as symptomatic of the triumph of materialism .  All of this has a distinctly Diceyesque ring ,  for in the introduction to the 1913 edition of his Law and Public Opinion  Dicey portrayed any extension of state activity as socialist ,  and denounced the welfare collectivism of the new liberalism as an attempt to bribe the electorate with state benefits .  However , Fforde 's acceptance of Dicey 's basic agenda reveals the weakness of his central argument , a weakness which is confirmed by his comment that the LPDL , an <head>organization</head> with which Dicey had close links , espoused the pure milk of Conservative orthodoxy . Fforde 's  error  ( and Eccleshall makes the same mistake )  is simply that the orthodoxy which Dicey and his friends in the LPDL espoused was not Conservatism but classical mid - Victorian Liberalism .  It is true that Dicey ,  the LPDL ,  and later the BCA ,  allied themselves with the Conservative party ,  but this was not because they considered themselves Conservatives .

The Conservative  Party was thus preserved intact ,  and the fact that it was able to provide a rallying point for the middle and lower middle classes was arguably one of the main bulwarks against political extremism in the 1920s and 1930s .

The above argument is predicated on Coetzee 's assumption that the disruptive potential of the new <head>organizations</head> had been contained and that the crisis of Conservatism was over before 1914 . Yet it is not obvious that this was the case .  Between 1912 and 1914 the Conservative Party was distinctly unsettled .

This Germanic organization remains extremely vague in Formen  and the reason seems to come from the paucity and dubiousness of Marx 's  sources for the construction of this mode of production .  In The German Ideology  Marx had used Tacitus as his source for tribal German society ,  but by the time of Formen  he became influenced by the nationalist and romantic nineteenth - century tradition of German historiography ,  a tradition which was to influence him even more later on ,  and which was to have a dramatic and harmful effect on Engels .  This tradition stressed how true Germanic society was still to be found in the <head>organization</head> of ancient local communities . It was egalitarian and free from the weakening and divisive influence of the Roman world and of urban society .  Within the local community it had survived during the Middle Ages and even to a certain extent right up to the nineteenth century ,  in spite of a foreign overlay of feudal institutions coming from western and southern Europe .

Marx in his notes changes this order and brings the discussion of property forward into the discussion of descent groups and family organization ,  while he keeps the discussion of the rise of the State till last .

The effectiveness of the Labour Spain Committee was impaired both by the fact that it was  was  associated with the movement in the constituency Labour parties and also because it was effectively advocating a  a  popular front against fascism ,  which the Labour Party continued to reject throughout the 1930s ;  after the political disasters of 1931 it wanted no treating with its political enemies whether of the left or the right .  The Labour Party leadership also felt that the British people were not ,  as yet ,  ready for war :  In Great Britain the position was that no Government would be able to secure public support for any action which the people believed would lead to war .   Nevertheless , whilst a joint campaign with the Communist Party and other political <head>organizations</head> was entirely out of the question , the Labour leadership felt compelled to adjust its policy with regard to Spain . Shortly after the Edinburgh Conference ,  the National Council of Labour ,  which brought the executives of the TUC and the Labour Party together ,  agreed that the Spanish government should have its commercial rights restored .  By June 1937 the National Council of Labour ,  effectively speaking for the Labour Party ,  decided to reverse its Edinburgh policy and to oppose non - intervention .

The new town development was not sited on Londonderry but between the largely Protestant towns of Lurgan and Portadown .  Certainly one would have to agree that O'Neill did little to change either the reality or Catholic perceptions of their subordinate position in the polity and the economy but his failure almost certainly owed more to his lack of power than to his lack of desire .  Farrell uses the fact that O'Neill joined the Apprentice Boys of Derry and the Royal Black Preceptory ( two Protestant fraternal <head>organizations</head> similar to the Orange Order ) to portray him as a closet die - hard unionist but in so doing misses the glaring point that O'Neill had to join these organizations because he was not already a member .

Fred Procter ,  by then a DUP Belfast city councillor ,  was shot ,  apparently by the UVF ,  who objected to his spirited criticisms of  gangsterism on the Shankill Road .  The fighting between the UVF and UDA , and the struggles for power within the UDA , did much to damage the reputation of the working - class loyalist <head>organizations</head> and to permit the professional politicians to regain control after the UWC strike . What also helped to undermine their credibility were the claims that the UDA and UVF were socialist or communist .

As part of the course , she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a <head>paper</head> ; one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views , not just copy already received opinions . She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .  Happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about Michelangelo ,  and has a route map prepared ,  including introductory and background books ,  but also passages from longer scholarly works .

Typically ,  a laudatory essay he wrote was called The Painter of Modern Life  on the subject of the illustrator Constantin Guys ;  this gifted if minor artist was accurately targeted by Baudelaire as being in the mainstream of contemporary social and political life .  Guys '  drawings appeared in such papers as the Illustrated London News  ,  a very successful venture begun in 1842 ,  the decade which also saw the founding of satirical journals like  Punch  or Kladderadatsch  .  The illustrated periodical was a phenomenon of a world which Baudelaire saw as reborn on Guys ' <head>paper</head> : Natural and more than natural ,  beautiful and more than beautiful ,  strange and endowed with an impulsive life like the soul of its creator He is looking for that quality which you must allow me to call modernity ;  for I know of no better word to express the idea I have in mind .

A solo exhibition can vary in scope from the minimum ,  that is to say a show of recent work ,  through a more extended selection to the apogee of a retrospective exhibition .  We have already looked at writing in catalogues ,  and can now turn our attention to the critical responses which appear in articles .  The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it appears , as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's dismissal from the New York Times because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the <head>paper</head> 's readers . The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication .  Some trial and error should eliminate the laziest papers ,  whose critics do no more than pillage catalogue introductions ,  or even press releases .

The three tales are deftly assembled and get on very well together .  Chatterton is represented in the novel as an accidental suicide  slain by a cocktail of arsenic and laudanum swallowed for a venereal infection .  Poor Charles brings him to life again , however , for some further plagiarisms : a nest of antique - dealers , of antic disposition , in Chatterton 's native Bristol , have passed to Charles a cache of <head>papers</head> which , together with the discovery of what seems to be the portrait of an adult Chatterton , persuades him that the poet lived on . The portraits of Chatterton have something of the importance to the novel that the living and ageing likeness has in The Picture of Dorian Gray  .  Like Hawksmoor  and The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde  ,  this novel is a tour de force  .

The tape was then passed through an automatic transmitter ,  turning individual perforations into dot/dash signals for the line and considerably improving speed of the telegraph .

Letter :  The real Pharisees From Rabbi JOHN D. RAYNER Sir : While tending to agree with the Archbishop of Canterbury 's social critique as reported in your <head>paper</head> ( 'Runcie attack on Pharisees revives rift with Tories ' , 2 October ) , I find his reference to the Pharisees more than a little unfortunate . For about 100 years Jewish and Christian scholars have demonstrated over and over again that the stereotype of the Pharisees found in the Gospels is a distortion which reflects the animosity of the Evangelists rather than the historical truth or even the attitude of Jesus himself .  Far from being inclined towards self - righteousness ,  the Pharisees taught Be humble before all men ,  and revered their teacher Hillel for his extreme humility ;  and far from being judgemental ,  they urged Do not judge your fellow man until you are in his position and Always judge others by the scale of merit  ( that is ,  charitably )  .

In the 1950s and 1960s the royal castles were examined in detail by various authorities ,  but it was the great baronial buildings in Wales that attracted King .  From the 1950s through to the early 1980s he published an important series of papers ,  the majority in the Cambrian Archaeological Association 's  Archaeologia Cambrensis ,  notably on the Pembrokeshire castles of Carew ,  Manorbier and Pembroke ,  and the native Welsh castles of Dinas Bran and Caergwrle in the north of the principality .  At the same time as he was working on individual buildings , King produced his lists of all the castles in Wales and the Marches , as well as more detailed <head>papers</head> on the counties of Breconshire and Cardiganshire . His fieldwork in England and Wales led him to visit virtually every castle with visible remains ,  from humble earthwork upwards ,  culminating in the publication of his Castellarium Anglicanum  ( 1983 )  .  This two - volume work details all the castles built in England and Wales ,  and reference will always be made to it as long as castles are studied .

With so many pages ,  the decision to divide the paper into separate sections :  home and foreign news ,  society and culture ,  economics and business news with special supplements ,  books and ideas on Friday ,  arts and listings on Thursday and a radio/television guide at the weekend ,  has been dictated by the problems of readability as much as anything else .

The postwar generation ,  unschooled in the brutality of hardships of war and reconstruction ,  compares its lot with that of West Germans ,  with double their standard of living ,  rather than with their neighbours to the East ,  to whom the mountains of sausages and pigs '  trotters in butchers '  shops would seem like a dream come true .

Yesterday , Achievements marched up and down the grey columns of the party <head>paper</head> Neues Deutschland with more than usual determination . The solid education system ,  full if unexciting shops ,  the fact that East Germany is socialism 's  only economic miracle ,  ranking among the world 's  top 10 industrial countries  it all bores people unspeakably ,  as much as those triumphal lists of foreign dignitaries attending today 's  ceremonies ,  and the constant reminder that 135 countries recognise the 1945 Soviet occupation zone as a second German state .

At present , trade in African ivory worth millions of dollars is allowed by CITES , under a system of quotas , with tusk markings and shipment <head>papers</head> designed to catch out sales of poached tusks . The quota system ,  which critics claim permits poached ivory to enter legal trade ,  was set up as African elephant numbers fell from an estimated 1.3 million in 1979 to about 600,000 today .  The dispute arises because poaching and habitat destruction has vastly reduced elephant herds in central and eastern Africa ,  but wildlife management further south has meant rising populations ,  which are regularly culled to raise foreign exchange .

Annely Juda has used the gallery 's  three floors to divide the exhibits into three distinct groups .

The first floor contains <head>paper</head> sculptures he has used torn , cut , folded and painted paper to form provocative jumbles contained in plexiglass cases ; these abstract explorations of texture and form , which closely parallel his metal pieces , are attractively priced at 10,000 .

Katharine Hamnett is a contradictory ,  impulsive figure :  a feminist who sells on sex ,  a vegetarian hedonist ,  a Labour voter with two sons at private school and a 20m turnover .

( Though it certainly got Hamnett 's clothes in the <head>papers</head> ) . Katharine Hamnett 's  instinct for kicking against the Establishment comes partly out of the mind - set of her own particular generation ,  partly out of a reaction to an upper middle - class upbringing .

Readers of right - wing <head>papers</head> were well aware of their papers ' pro - Conservative and anti - Labour bias though less unanimous about their papers ' anti - Alliance bias .

As a <head>party</head> , it really only exercised a modicum of power in relation to the Stormont administration .

Later the hierarchy made it clear that the basis for their objections was the increase in power by the state vis -  - vis  the liberty and self - reliance of its citizens which such legislation would entail .

The members of his <head>party</head> appeared to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill , and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 . When he was told of the hierarchy 's  opposition to any bill of this kind ,  Dr Browne ,  himself secularly inclined ,  submitted his proposals and arguments to the hierarchy for approval ,  just as a previous Health Minister ,  Dr Walsh ,  had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 .

This was an initiative sponsored by the SDLP at first intended to bring together politicians from both catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist groups to discuss the future of the island as a whole .  In reality only the major nationalist parties participated .  Loyalist <head>parties</head> refused to join in , and the Provisional Sinn Fein was excluded by the fact that the ground rules for the forum only allowed parties accepting constitutional , nonviolent politics to participate . The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 .  There was one vital breakthrough for the nationalist consciousness ,  though there still remains some doubt as to how deep this was for the Fianna Fil party :  all the parties committed themselves to the recognition of the protestant  loyalist group as having legitimate aspirations and affirmed the need for the recognition of two sets of legitimate rights coexisting in the island as a whole :  Constitutional nationalists are determined to secure justice for all traditions

It indicated that Charles Haughey in particular ,  and Fianna Fil in  general were moving behind the anti - divorce lobby .

In early May ,  two - thirds of Fianna Fil TDs from the West had already indicated they would campaign in their constituencies against the amendment  (  Irish Times  ,  2 May 1986 )  .

If you achieved such a quantity of quality work in the theatre ,  they would be tipping you to lead the RSC .  In television ,  it just slips quietly by ,  but we should hope that there will always be people to run the kind of BBC in which such drama  literate ,  socially sensitive and lovingly crafted  can be done .  Should television be the voice of the <head>party</head> or the voice of the people ? , asked a witness in Red Dynasty ( BBC 2 ) . The speaker was a Chinese television news producer ,  acknowledging a debate within her industry .  A new kind of documentary was on offer for viewers in Beijing :  populist ,  slightly Wilcocksy people shows .

Few want the wholesale repeal of industrial relations legislation .  Even the popular belief that the unions exercise too much power over Labour policies is gradually being accepted by a number of union leaders .  Paradoxically , the more moderate of them are insisting on the maintenance of their block votes because the <head>party</head> is still not fully democratic . They see themselves exercising the restraining ,  moderating role they played in the 1940s and 1950s .  Once one - person - one - vote is accepted ,  some have already signalled a willingness to surrender much of their power .

Across China there has been a ritualistic cleansing to erase the symbols of the student movement .  Noticeboards have been scrubbed clean of posters ,  walls of daubed slogans and minds of memories of what really happened .  Imitating the students ' tactics , the <head>party</head> has ordered shops and houses be strung with banners praising the great and glorious Communist Party of China . And ,  again like the students ,  it has issued an official list of permitted slogans ,  ordering citizens to memorise 40 different chants to mark the 40th anniversary of communist rule. Not as stirring as the protest movement 's  shouts of long live democracy ,  down with autocracy ,  they include cumbersome chants hailing the great achievement of socialism and warmly hail the victory over the turmoil and counter - revolutionary rebellion .

We are getting away from the labour party for industrial workers ,  says Walter Momper ,  the SPD mayor of Berlin and one of the new generation of leaders .  We are strong now on women 's  rights ,  the environment and disarmament .  This sort of language dismays the traditional ranks of SPD supporters , especially the big trade unions , who fear their voice within the <head>party</head> is being muffled . It has not always been easy for those working class voters who see the Greens as an undisciplined bunch ,  inimical to the interests of industrial society ,  to keep up with the SPD 's  enthusiastic appetite for environmental matters .  There has been a noticeable shift of working class support from the SPD to the far - right Republicans  not as much as the losses from the Christian Democrats ,  but enough to worry party managers .

The party leader ,  Hans - Jochen Vogel ,  a rather uninspiring figure ,  has nonetheless proved adept at managing this delicate evolution which ,  bolder than anything the Labour party ever contemplated ,  has avoided the sort of fratricidal bloodletting which ravaged its British counterpart .  The traditionalist camp has had to swallow some bitter pills .  Oskar Lafontaine , the SPD leader in the Saarland , has argued vociferously that a modern mass <head>party</head> like the SPD could not afford to have its policies confined to the narrow interests of employed industrial workers . In the party 's  new programme ,  the trade unions have had to backtrack on their central demand ,  now accepting that a shorter working week will mean reduced wages .  But Mr Lafontaine ,  standard - bearer of the up - and - coming generation ,  and the second most important figure after Mr Vogel on the committee drafting the party programme for the next decade ,  has certainly not had things all his own way .

His attempts to link reductions in working hours to more flexible work practices ,  for example ,  have run into powerful union resistance .

The <head>party</head> is far from sure which message it wants to send to voters , and is likely to leave the choice until the last minute . Neither of these two men can control with any certainty ,  however ,  the factor that will perhaps exert the most influence on the SPD 's  election chances .

KEN LIVINGSTONE was yesterday knocked off Labour 's  national executive in a vote which took the Brent East MP and his left - wing associates by surprise .

Robin Cook , the <head>party</head> 's health spokesman , who retained his executive seat by coming second , said the vote showed the degree to which the party wanted to elect people who devoted their energies to helping Labour to win the next election . Ken Livingstone 's  problem is that he is always on the television slagging the party off .  It may also turn out Mr Livingstone lost because more constituencies this year balloted their full membership ,  rather than leaving it to their activist general committees to decide .

Surprisingly ,  this is true of both the classical and modern play ,  though you might expect that the obscurities and difficulties of words and expression would prove more of a stumbling block in ,  say ,  Shakespeare or Ben Jonson .  Here is a suggested first reading list ,  which I 've put together to provide a broadly representative selection of significant periods in the theatre 's  development .  There is a danger in reading the classics , in that they can come to be regarded simply as literature so always try to look at them as plays for <head>performance</head> and , it goes without saying , try to see as much theatre as you can . It 's  worthwhile reading some pre - Shakespearean drama ;  you could read Everyman  ,  a great morality play of the late Middle Ages ,  and Gammer Gurton 's  Needle  ,  first performed in 1566 and thought to be the second oldest English comedy .  You should try to read as much as you can of the great Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists ;  Shakespeare ,  Marlowe and Ben Jonson ,  Beaumont and Fletcher ,  Tourneur ,  Webster ,  Middleton .

Remember this when the pace hots up !  Students usually find that the first term 's  work is relatively gentle .  At nearly all schools no stage <head>performances</head> will be seen by an audience until at least the end of the second term . Sometimes students get anxious about this ,  and believe they are not making audience contact early enough ;  but if you think about it ,  the reasoning is clear .

They are personal work - out sessions .  Altogether ,  tutorials take place over a period of about twenty - four weeks in the last year of a course ,  and usually by the last twelve tutorials a student has a much clearer idea of what he or she is about .  Where the tutorial focuses on current productions , I have found that students will work hard on their <head>performances</head> and be open about their work and any problems they may be having with the characters they are playing . A director may have made it plain that he has a definite intention for a character ,  but the student may not always see this straight away .

In effect we were becoming structurally and visibly undisciplined ,  in a world where discipline has its import spelled out  on every occasion .  For example ,  Section 5 ,  para .  14 of the West Mercia Force Standing Orders is entitled the Maintenance of Discipline ,  and contends :  Discipline is the foundation of the Force and means not only the <head>performance</head> of specific orders but implies a willing and prompt obedience , proper respect to senior officers and loyalty to the service . Over the years I watched as senior officers struggled to come to terms with our bizarre presence ,  which overcame any respect they might have had for our practical mastery of dealing with a world they were wary of .  Of course ,  our bodily forms and somewhat disorganized working systems were in contradiction to their understanding of the correct codes of policing .

Sir Neville Cardus ,  another great music critic writing about the history of music ,  likened the image of great composers such as Bach ,  Mozart and Beethoven as ,  Looking at a range of mountains ,  those names are on the summits then one comes to a plateau  and there standing out and rising from it is the cathedral of Csar Franck .  This statement exactly sums up the quality and feeling of Franck 's  music .  As organist and piano teacher most of it was composed for <head>performance</head> at some ritual , often in church it conveys not only the solemnity of the occasion but also the spaciousness of the building and the sound of the organ with its vast range of tonalities . It is without emotion but conveys a sense of reverence for order and serenity .

Once the basic structure fur a story ballet has been created ,  the choreographer must find ways of linking the beginning ,  climax and end so that the plot develops easily from one scene to the next .  This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music .  Since the first <head>performance</head> of Giselle , certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters appear . These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and audience to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players .  Adolphe Adam ,  composer of the music for Giselle  ,  initiated this idea which greatly influenced Wagner and later composers .

Fokine 's  Harlequin only gives a glimpse of his abilities .  Ashton 's  Puck in The Dream  uses all his bag of tricks as envisaged by Shakespeare .  The whole <head>performance</head> is based on the classical vocabulary of steps shorn of every convention so that he can go swifter than an arrow from an archer 's bow . Every leap ,  turn ,  beat and somersault is perfectly co - ordinated with the phrase and with the music despite the fact that the dance scarcely reflects the period when the music was composed as does Ashton 's  choreography in other ballets  ( see page 42 )  .  Choreographers should therefore note that it is possible to design movements which may contradict the music that is being played ,  but not if they contradict the mood and rhythmic qualities of the whole context .

Those on the input will be similar to what the standard Buck topology requires ;  those on the output ( s )  could be made smaller ,  though the reduction is limited by the need to keep enough capacitance  to absorb fast load transients .  To summarise ,  the Cuk converter has an apparent advantage over standard Buck topology in that it uses an integrated magnetic structure and can reduce input and output ripple currents to very low levels .  On the other hand , the required energy coupling capacitors cause problems and can be expensive at higher current levels , and there does not seem to be any proof that there is a volume , weight , or cost saving over the standard Buck topology for any given equivalent <head>performance</head> level . All credit is due to Terrence Finnegan for his two recent articles which ,  for the first time ,  have made available useful and usable designinformation .  Nevertheless the Cuk converter topology seems likely to remain an outsider until a true trade - off comparison can be made between Cuk and Buck at a series of realistic equivalent performance levels ,  a task that would take a lot of time ,  but whose results would be of great interest to many in the power supply design field .

The humour inheres not just in the daffy selection of cultural allusions  ( their native French accordion ,  some flamenco guitar ,  a few African horns )  but also in the way they take stiff ,  formal tempi  ( waltzes and tangos )  and mockingly squeeze them for their stateliness .

His book entitled The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy avoids a chronological sequence , since his <head>plan</head> of arrangement was to build up a mosaic of characteristic material . As he explained :  My starting point has to be a vision ,  otherwise I cannot do anything .  Vision I call not only optical ,  but also spiritual realization ;  for instance ,  historical vision issuing from the old sources .

The presbyterians also had misgivings ,  and only came back into the system in 1838 when they were practically guaranteed control of their own schools within it .

Times change ,  however ,  and today ,  under a somewhat different corporate regime ,  Heritage starts to smack of yesterday 's  fashion ,  and one is not entirely sure what commitment remains .  Already the other Tetley Heritage Pub in York ,  The Swan ,  is out on lease to an independent retailing chain .  Moreover , the very same Tetley 's who so lovingly restored The Fox are now building , in the heart of a residential suburb not two miles away , an open - <head>plan</head> eating barn that contravenes all the accepted standards of enlightened and community - sensitive pub design . Reliance on the brewers '  better nature is a precarious sort of dependency ,  where today 's  Jekyll can be tomorrow 's  Hyde .

Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced ,  ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen ,  other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to produce rustic charm .  At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - <head>plan</head> which now seem to be pubs ' standard internal layout . Often the creation of the open plan interior requires the removal of walls ,  chimney breasts ,  stairs and other internal features of interest ,  which is highly destructive of the building 's  historic character .  The owner of The Hollybush at Elstree proposed to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's  facade and to demolish the timber framed side walls of the passageway behind in order to form a larger and open interior ,  even though it was this feature that distinguished the building as an historic inn .

The first indications of the new 1979 Conservative Government 's  attitude to investment became apparent when BR sought approval to build an  additional seven HST sets to cope with the first flush of growth following the launch of 125mph services on the East Coast main line the previous year .  After much haggling ,  approval was only obtained for those four out of the seven sets which could meet the much higher rate of return which would henceforth be applied to BR investment .  If BR could not make a case for seven trains for one of its most profitable routes , it was clear that <head>plans</head> for a second tranche of HSTs for the Cross Country group of services would not satisfy the new criteria . These were the circumstances which led BR to terminate HST building with a fleet of ninety - five operational trains .  It is a matter of history that as the 1980s drew to a close ,  a few extra HSTs to cope with the unprecedented levels of business by now on offer would have been very welcome .

At a fringe meeting at the Labour conference in Brighton ,  Mr Fletcher named three MPs who ,  he said ,  backed Muslim schools because their constituencies had been manipulated by unrepresentative fundamentalists :  Jack Straw  ( Blackburn )  ,  the education spokesman ;  Roy Hattersley  ( Birmingham Sparkbrook )  ,  the deputy leader ;  and Ken Livingstone  ( Brent East )  .

The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student ,  and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece .

Major roles for older women are not so common in Shakespeare ,  but I think it is better not to choose a character such as Queen Katherine from Henry VIII  ,  who needs a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic interest .  If you do want to portray an older figure ,  it would be preferable to try Hermione in The Winter 's  Tale   she is a more fantastical character ,  without the added complications of historical authenticity ,  and so allows for greater flexibility of characterisation .

Letters and the curriculum vitae Writing letters about yourself is never easy  we tend either to say too much or too little .

It was not only a constitution which really was and is effective in the running of the state ,  but which was itself the product of the hegemonic culture already established .  Whyte  ( 1980 )  provides several instances of the influence of the Roman catholic moral code in both state decision - making and in public behaviour from 1922 through to the 1950s .  The most interesting one , in which clergy , local people , and the Dil all <head>played</head> their part , was the case of the protestant librarian in County Mayo , 19301 . A woman protestant was appointed as county librarian ,  but when the county library committee met to ratify the appointment ,  it refused to do so by ten votes to two .  The committee was largely made up of Roman catholic clergy ,  and they clearly opposed the appointment on the grounds that a protestant could not be trusted to safeguard the catholic morals of her charges in her purchase and loaning of books .

During the 20th century an historic architectural character  perhaps most typically that of the timber framed building  has become popular with ,  and desirable to ,  both publicans and brewers .  In many cases this has resulted in the introduction of faked features and the associated destruction of existing features which ,  though often of architectural and historic interest in their own right ,  do not fit in with the designer 's  concept of the pub 's  ideal form .  Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced , ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen , other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to <head>produce</head> rustic charm . At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs '  standard internal layout .

The answer must be not a great deal ;  for none of the portents of success are immediately apparent .  WPC Dick 's  salutary essay  ( 1985 )  changed little and generated few ripples on the ACPO pond ,  while one of the most powerfully critical books on policing in recent years  ( Jones 1980 )  seems to have had little effect on the structures of the organization ,  except ,  perhaps ,  to help draw its author  then a chief inspector  into the ACPO ranks .

Quite often the divisional boundaries in the amalgamated force mirror the old ,  small force boundaries and men define themselves  in relation to their early experience with perhaps an inner city ethic ,  a large - town police style ,  or in the framework of a more rural situation .  In each case they inevitably begin to denigrate their opposite numbers for not doing real police work .  Tribalism in the pre - amalgamated forces <head>produced</head> a very constricted vision of the world , so that spatial concepts and a narrow geographical containment held a paramount place in determining police reality . Today these are still of immense import ,  with men deriding those in another division or section ,  bragging that their villains are the toughest or their section tasks more numerous and arduous .  An expressed desire for rigidly determined geographical units separated from a despised neighbour occurs again and again in my fieldnotes ,  and is clearly illustrated in a note made in 1981 ,  when a superintendent in a somewhat remote subdivision laughingly told me :

Disguise your steps with feints that make the opponent blink ,  or which divert his attention elsewhere .

Circular techniques do not <head>produce</head> the same flinch and are correspondingly less effective at disguising a follow - up. However ,  even with straight jabs it is important that the technique looks effective .

The point of the experiments was this :  strong social pressure  was being put on these children to agree to a realist answer  ( they were not allowed out of the room until they had an answer !  )  and if their usual tendency to interpret questions phenomenally is a trivial and weak effect then this social pressure should obliterate it .  The result was that the social pressure had no effect at all .  In children between four and eight years of age there was absolutely no difference between the number of realist answers <head>produced</head> by the pairs and by the control , solo children . They knew the realist option but did not take it as a way out of a social impasse ,  because ,  I would argue ,  the phenomenalist tendency of thought is too strong .

Muscles are made up of fibres which have different mechanical properties ,  and two of the main groups of fibres are called fast twitch fibres and slow twitch fibres .  The fast twitch fibres have a much higher contraction speed and are associated with dynamic bursts of energy .  The slow twitch fibres react much more slowly and are more resistant to fatigue , <head>producing</head> greater endurance . Thus it is clear that you need to work on the fast twitch muscles if you want to improve your speed .  The ratio of fast twitch to slow twitch fibres varies between individuals and is determined by heredity .

Authority was obtained for the modernisation of the Chiltern line between Marylebone and Banbury via Bicester including resignalling and the provision of seventy - seven Class 165 Networker coaches ,  and in August the then new Minister of Transport ,  Cecil Parkinson ,  authorised the first hundred Networker four - car trains for the North Kent lines .  The decade could hardly have ended on a more optimistic note .  While it has to be obvious that current success has been built on foundations that were perhaps sounder than people generally thought ten years ago , the combination of a livelier economy and greater commercial drive ( leading above all to more commonsense , usually more local management ) has <head>produced</head> results far above the most rosy forecasts . The pride taken not only by many staff but passengers in their more clearly identified Lines is paying handsome dividends .  But four main factors are singled out by Chris Green for the currently greatly improved outlook :  the record investment currently being made ,  at the end of 1989 amounting to an astonishing million pounds a day ;  the success of the Networker train whose carriages in 1989 were being delivered at the rate of one a day ;  the enormous level of London station development both enhancing the environment  ( who at the start of the 1980s would have thought of treating a terminus as a shopping precinct ?  )  and producing revenue on the grand scale ;  and the steady introduction of Integrated Electronic Control Centres  ( discussed in detail in the signalling chapter )  .

The question had to be asked :  could the purchase of new trains produce savings sufficient to cover the cost of servicing their capital costs as well as reducing the burden on the PSO ?

It was intended as a high - performance set which could inherit the reliability associated with previous BR  ( SR )  DEMUs ,  thus beating the older ,  inherently unreliable diesel - mechanical multiple units hands down. Its problem ,  when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .

The voltage induced in the pickup coil by this waveform is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic induction .

All of the above assumes that the only influence on the core is the magnetic field <head>produced</head> by the excitation coil . If this is not the case and the core is affected by an additional external field ,  a small change takes place in the output .

In October 1990 ,  Hamadi Jebali ,  who is a member of the executive council of Hizb al - Nahda ,  had received a six month 's  suspended sentence and a fine of 1500 dinars for publishing an article entitled The people of the State or the State of the people ?  in Al - Fajr in June 1990 .

Since its implementation ,  fines totalling more than 24 million have been imposed under the Act and clearly some airlines have adopted practices aimed at minimizing the number of penalties incurred .

For centuries the Roman catholic church and faith were the bread of life to the subordinate classes in Ireland ,  deprived of their land ,  civil rights ,  and education .  The church not only provided solace and comfort in those long years ,  but also a vigorous identity which enabled its people to hold up their heads amid the persecution and oppression .  It <head>provided</head> intellectual and spiritual leadership and some alleviation from hunger and starvation . The clergy were the only source of education apart from the hedge school teachers  ( Dowling 1968 )  and provided a significant moral and organizational resource .  Several aspects of catholicism became particularly important in the nineteenth century .

An indicator of the growing importance of this totalizing view of education was contained in the 1841 rescript from Rome .  It announced that ,  if doctrine as opposed to Bible stories was to be a part of school education ,  then such religious education could not adopt a common denominator approach between the churches ,  but had to be total in its presentation of what the Roman catholic church considered to be the truth ,  otherwise such an approach would be dangerous for the children  ( Gaine 1968 :  164 )  .  The implementation of this policy was the work in part of the new Roman episcopal appointees , from Cullen onwards , though the growing hatred of the ascendancy because of the famine and their continued landownership must have <head>provided</head> ample cause for separate schools for the majority of Roman catholic clergy . Already in the 1850s ,  Roman catholic bishops attacked the setting up of the model schools ,  intended for the pursuit of educational experiments within a multi - denominational setting .  In 1860 ,  the rules on the composition of the National Education Board was changed to permit equal protestant and catholic representation .

A pub ,  like any other old building ,  is far more than just its principle facade ,  or its four walls .  As Neil Richardson noted in 1980 ,  An old town pub is not just an attractive Victorian or Georgian facade ,  it is a building which is still being used for the purpose for which it was built .  The design of interiors are as valid today as they were in earlier times the vaults , snugs , parlours , each with their own character , can still <head>provide</head> a pleasant , varied atmosphere . However ,  to public and professionals alike many old buildings are still regarded as representing little more than four external walls .  This even applies to listed buildings :  there is still a worryingly widespread general belief that listing only covers the facade ,  or perhaps just the exterior ,  whereas it is of course expressly designed to protect the whole  building .

Unexpected stalls Most unintentional stalls occur ,  by definition ,  unexpectedly and usually the first obvious sign of what has happened is that the pilot is banging the stick on the rear stop with the nose still dropping  a frightening feeling .  However , <head>provided</head> that a movement forwards is made to unstall , the possibility of a full spin will have been avoided . The order of movements is relatively unimportant compared to the necessity of making an immediate forward movement to reduce the angle of attack of the wing so that it unstalls .  If you imagine suddenly and unexpectedly finding yourself in an almost vertical dive facing the ground ,  it is easy to understand why so many pilots fail to make a movement forward on the stick to help the glider unstall itself .

Furthermore ,  the reading I did for the lectures I was called to give as a drugs expert generated queries about such ambiguous areas as victimless crimes and interference in private acts ,  and altogether raised more questions than were solved .  This acquisition of special knowledge meant that when I was called to give evidence to the Advisory Council on Drug Abuse  ( chaired by Baroness Wooton )  on the use of cannabis ,  I was perhaps more inclined to dwell on the symbolic dangers attributed to its use than on any alleged physical harm ,  simply because I was now aware that any reality in relation to cannabis use was more complex than could be contained in some easy binary of social value  medical debilitation .  Such awareness <head>provided</head> another means for the obsessive anxieties of the establishment to be counterbalanced from within , and as Jacobi ( 1967 : 22 ) suggests , created the potential ability to look truths in the eye and the courage to renounce what is no longer compatible . This ,  however ,  produces a further paradox ,  for this reflexive style ,  welding the practical mastery and special knowledge of the subjective insider to an objective interpretation of events is not one the institution of policing is  geared up to handle .  We were now floating between a world of the street - wise ,  the gentle hippie ,  the communal crash pad ,  the lecture hall ,  the courts ,  the addiction unit or hospital casualty department ,  and the front page .

If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content  ( and see Dennett ,  1988 ,  for some powerful arguments that it is not )  ,  then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena .  Successful Science The sceptic might , at this point , complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position , I have not <head>provided</head> any convincing arguments as to why one should believe it . What I now want to suggest is that there is a lot of very successful science currently being conducted which literally depends on functionalism being true .

Over a year or two ,  therefore ,  we have shifted from a population of recently diagnosed AIDS patients ,  often reasonably well but with lives dominated by a threat of pneumonia ,  to a population surviving longer and developing a range of further complex problems of a chronic debilitating nature .  As London 's  largest independent provider of community care for people ill with AIDS ,  staff at ACET have seen these changes unfold in the home .  While numbers of new AIDS cases reported officially each month have <head>remained</head> relatively steady , there has been a big increase in those needing expert medical and nursing advice at home with a 24 - hour on call back up. The numbers with pain are also higher .  Those at home often need opiates  ( morphine - like medicines )  for pain ,  while one in five will also need a special battery - operated syringe pump ,  especially if they are too weak to swallow .

The increase was even felt to be too great :  in 1964 ,  when British groups reached 212 ,  it was decided to slow down the growth in the UK  not to act upon the ephemeral  enthusiasms of an odd individual ,  but to go for quality .

This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place ,  furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism .  Despite this development ,  the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued ,  the original republicans developing a populist ,  nationalist party ,  and the former treaty party developing a concern with law and order ,  and moderation on the national question .  But the fight did not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and the historic integrity of the island of Ireland , as nationalist parties described it in their New Ireland Forum ( 1983 4 : i . 28 ) , from <head>remaining</head> basic to the perceptions of both parties .

Sodalities ,  such as the Legion of Mary ,  Opus Dei ,  and Christian Life communities ,  have partially extended this form of commitment to some ,  particularly more middle - class laity ,  and continue to have an important role in activating laity for what are judged to be religious goals both personally and socially .  But generally speaking the ideal has always tended to accentuate the gap between the clerical world view and the lay world view within catholicism .  Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed , with clergy being left behind in some areas , the clerics <head>remain</head> the true cognoscenti in religious matters , and are expected to be so by the laity . This has always added to the clergy 's  spiritual authority and status ,  and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals ,  with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals .  The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life .

If they who are elected to legislate for our society should unfortunately decide to pass a disastrous measure of legislation that will allow the public promotion of contraception and an access hitherto unlawful to the means of contraception ,  they ought to know clearly the meaning of their action ,  when it is judged by the norms of objective morality  and the certain consequences of such a law It may well come to pass that legislation could be enacted that will offend the objective moral law  .

As we shall see ,  there is now a specifically created police culture of the dramatic ,  which incorporates illusion ,  praxis ,  and imagery as part of a well - directed social production .  It rejoices in an enhanced belief in Manichaean and mythological archetypes of good and evil which are made manifest in exaggerated games of cops and robbers .  Series of interlinking metaphors of chaos and inhumanity are generated to maintain this dramatic mode and ensure that the agenda for control <head>remains</head> firmly with the system , and already I have used such metaphorical terms as animals and enemies to indicate some of the ways in which those in power make use of the rich imagination contained in everyday language . As Lakoff and Johnson  ( 1980 :  157 )  remind us :  whether in national politics or in everyday interaction ,  people in power get to impose their metaphors .  So when the police declare  ( as they do )  that they are non - political institution ,  this can only be a partial truth .

He concluded the bill was a legislator 's  attempt to assume institutions work on the kind of rational and ordered basis which they outwardly pretend .  In this he recognizes the same problem which faces the insider/ethnographer ,  for he clearly understands that pretence ,  deception ,  and bizarre social drama play a large part in police culture and accepts this will be difficult to research .  However , he is optimistic ( as any professional researcher must <head>remain</head> ! ) , for he cites Sir Kenneth Newman 's efforts as the new commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to make police ethics a major issue , so that performance assessment , promotion criteria etc. , will take integrity and professional conduct more and more into account . With hindsight it seems that the prevailing structures of police practice will remain as powerful as ever ,  for at a conference on policing at Bristol University  ( 1988 )  ,  the newly retired Sir Kenneth admitted that police culture had defeated many of his attempts to bring a new ethic to the managerial style during his reign as commissioner of the metropolis .

In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos ,  a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem ,  and the detective and the chief officer now operate at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they produce .  Inevitably ,  as a secular interpretation of morality has superseded that of established religion ,  so the  activities of the social controller have become increasingly important in the drama .  It can be no accident that the opinion of the police officer is now sought on matters which once would have <head>remained</head> the province of the archbishop and his clergy . The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins ,  we find that Stalker ,  Sampson ,  Anderton ,  Alderson ,  Newman ,  Imbert ,  Dear ,  Oxford ,  and Hermon are national personalities ,  while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police .  Yet Robert Reiner  ( 1989 )  ,  writing on the collective culture of chief constables ,  is the first to explore their extraordinary place in modern society ,  simply because as an lite among the powerful in society they have had little need to reveal how they operate ,  link together ,  or reveal what structures of significance guide their actions .

It may also be the reason why ,  in its forty - year history ,  the Police Staff College has never achieved any real academic status ;  for ,  as Lewis  ( ibid .  183 )  also points out :  there is a deep feeling that academic training gets between a policeman and his knowing and getting the respect of the crude masses of a very crude ,  very egalitarian and anti - intellectual European race the police  have indeed a general belief that they know more psychology than academics .  Always the demand is for practical skills , while academic analysis <head>remains</head> a despised pastime , so that even the Superintendents ' Association ( the equivalent of the Police Federation for the lower ranks ) has similarly denied any place for intellectualism for its members . At their 1974 conference they decided :  It is time to end the service 's  love affair with education .  Although this conference comment is now well over fifteen years old it still holds good .

I cannot see that one voting system is intrinsically more fair than another .  It is not fair ,  perhaps ,  that with 23 per cent of the vote the Alliance should have won only 3 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons .  But nor is it fair that with 6 or 7 per cent of the vote , the West German liberals should be the sole arbiters of who <head>rules</head> in Bonn . The case for electoral reform is best discussed in terms of the question :  what kind of political system do we want ?  Our electoral system strongly favours two - party government ;  other people 's  systems ,  in varying degree proportionate ,  result in coalitions of a usually centrist tinge .

What the paper scathingly called the story of the refugees had been whipped up by a noisy propaganda campaign dripping with chauvinism and nationalism .  And behind the West German media stood the country 's  politicians ,  nursing illusions about the recreation of a new German Reich with the pre - war frontiers of 1937 .  Such language is infinitely more virulent that anything emanating from the Soviet foreign ministry after the deal four days ago between Bonn and East Berlin , which allowed some some 5,000 East Germans who had taken <head>shelter</head> in the two embassies to leave unmolested for the West . Hitherto its spokesmen have insisted that the affair was essentially one for East Germany to settle ,  albeit urging that West Germany must operate its embassies abroad in conformity with standard international practice .  To an extent ,  the anger is to be expected from a newspaper which has become a strident mouthpiece of conservative elements in the Kremlin leadership .

For this reason ,  many of these structures have disappeared .  The number and size of the buildings of the farmstead was affected not only by the size of the farm but also by the type of farming practised .

On a mixed farm ,  there would be a larger number of buildings for cattle ,  while on a pastoral farm the reduced need for waggon horses caused the stables to be small and there would be little accommodation for crops .

Nevertheless ,  it is also clear that there is scope for increasing the agricultural production of the crofts .  Some of us felt that more attention could be paid to this aspect ,  particularly in order to obtain a greater economic return for the heavy expenditure on government assistance .  The principal way in which the agricultural production of the crofts has been increased is through the improvement of pasture by fencing , planting <head>shelter</head> - belts , liming ( usually with shell sand ) , fertilizing and surface seeding . Although such improvement has been vigorously promoted by the North of Scotland College of Agriculture  ( which is responsible for agricultural extension and training in the area )  ,  the response has ,  after some initial enthusiasm ,  been extremely disappointing .  By 1979 only about 6,000 ha in Lewis and Harris  ( no more than 4 %  of the total common grazing )  had been the subject of the grants available under the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme .

Miller liked his ground cover to be permanent and he has not included any of the undershrubs ,  which are of short duration ,  such as Southernwood ,  Rosemary ,  Lavender ,  Lavender Cotton ,  etc. because whenever these decay ,  they occasion gaps in the plantation .  Next he grouped the climbing ,    shrubby plants needing support or fastening and these are followed by hardy evergreen trees and shrubs .

Ben Ami lies just five miles south of the Lebanese border , well within range of the Katyusha rockets which were then being fired by Palestinian guerrillas around Tyre and Rashidiyeh ; there were concrete air - raid <head>shelters</head> with iron doors between the bungalows . Barbed wire zigzagged in front of the small houses and large Alsatians snarled at strangers from behind steel fences .  The people of Ben Ami were not frightened but they were prepared for an enemy ;  and visitors interested in the ArabJewish war of 1948 were well advised to present convincing explanations for their questions before they stirred memories too deeply .

A number of demands which were to be raised by the civil rights movement were taken up by the manifesto .  The NILP pledged an extension of the city boundary and the extension of the local government franchise to all citizens over the age of twenty - one ,  the abolition of the company vote ,  the realignment of electoral boundaries and the allocation of houses solely on the basis of need .  These objectives were wrapped up in a programme that included pledges on road safety , home helps for the elderly , bus <head>shelters</head> , a more comprehensive library system and the encouragement of tourism . Many of them were possible only if the NILP got control of Stormont and were propaganda points in its ideological war against the doctrines of Orange and Green .  In the Catholic South ward the NILP polled 34.5 per cent ,  a similar proportion to that of McGonagle and Quinn in Foyle and an  indication that the existing political mould was not going to be broken easily .

The importance of grazing both cows and sheep over the same land  ( either together or in succession )  ,  both for the good of the sward and the health of the livestock ,  is explained at the beginning of Chapter 6 .  Set stocking ,  in which animals are given free range over a relatively large area and not moved regularly ,  is the most labour - saving system of grazing .  The provision of water may well be easier and <head>shelter</head> in foul weather more readily available somewhere in a large area than in a small paddock or strip . The main disadvantages of set stocking are the buildup of intestinal worms and the growth of tussocks of coarse ,  unpalatable grass where animals have dunged .  Paddock grazing ,  in which the grassland is divided into small paddocks ,  grazed hard for a short period and then rested for up to three weeks ,  is a very good system for the control of parasite worms ,  the life cycle of which is broken during the rest periods .

Grown men buckle under the fear that these relentless ,  dancing grey clouds bring .  Men who can cling to overhanging rocks thousands of feet above their companions ,  men who climb into perilous situations in the knowledge they are inches from death ,  men who are strong enough and man enough to meet any  physical challenge ,  these are the men who call for their mum when they find they left the jungle Formula back in the car .

Of course you will wake up in the morning with a nervous disorder and a slightly lower IQ ,  but at least you wo n't have any itchy red lumps .  The only other piece of important advice is that ,  although you can walk anywhere in Scotland ,  you are not entitled to camp without permission .

Wild Boar Fell rises to 2324 feet above the sea and is the dominant height between the Lake District and the main Pennine range ,  overlooking the nearby Howgill Fells and all else for many miles around .  The distinctive profile of the eastern edge of the summit is a feature instantly recognised in the landscape of the upper Eden valley .  It overlooks the birthplace of the lovely River Eden and nurtures and <head>shelters</head> its flow down the long strath of Mallerstang towards an ultimate destination in the Solway Firth . The fell is reputedly the last place in England where a wild boar was killed ,  hence the name ,  and has other claims to distinction .  A tumulus on the summit ridge is evidence that it was known ,  probably as a hunting ground ,  and may indeed have been occupied as a settlement by primitive man.

The highest point has an Ordnance column in the <head>shelter</head> of a sturdy wall but , apart from the view , which includes a bird 's - eye sighting of the Ribblehead railway viaduct far below , there is little inducement to linger . Two features ,  however ,  give Whernside a measure of distinction :  on the northern approach three large tarns are passed ,  a surprise in a district notable for its absence of standing water ,  and on the southern slopes around and below the 1200 - ft contour is a belt of limestone with an attendant necklace of potholes .  Whernside feeds the two streams that entrance visitors to Ingleton with their succession of lovely waterfalls .

Nearer our own time ,  in 1830 ,  when the extensive manor of Ingleton changed hands ,  the new owner had a tower intended as a hospice erected on the summit ,  made from stone pillaged from the wall and the foundations of the huts .  The edifice was short lived :  on the day of the opening ceremony ,  the assembled crowd of visitors got out of control during the festivities and dismantled the building ,  reducing it to the great heap of stones to be seen today .  Nearby , a wall <head>shelter</head> intended as a wind break , was fitted with a view indicator in 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II . The summit is 2373 feet above the sea ,  not a great altitude ,  but to the many pilgrims who climb to it time and time again ,  it is a stepping stone to heaven .   For me and the growing number of cavers and potholers ,  the fascination of Ingleborough is centred on the band of limestone at and below mid - height .

Lovell gave Coleridge food that night , but not <head>shelter</head> , and in the days that followed was responsible with Southey for introducing him to a city strong in religious dissent and political radicalism . One meeting of particular significance was with a young dissenting bookseller called Joseph Cottle ,  whose shop stood at the corner of Corn Street and High Street ,  a few yards from Southey 's  birthplace .  Cottle ,  who four years later was to publish the Lyrical Ballads  and in old age produced his garrulous and unreliable Reminiscences  ,  immediately saw in Coleridge the signs of commanding genius ,  but reserved for Southey 's  great suavity of manners his more enthusiastic praise .

In Kuwait ,  Al - Nakshabandi and El - Robee  ( 1988 )  have shown that aeolian deposition has resulted in decreased productivity or complete failure of many agricultural enterprises .  In contrast to the Sahel zone which is classified as semi - arid ,  Kuwait is arid  (  Desertification Map of the World  ,  FAO/Unesco 1977 )  so it is to be expected that desertification is a prominent problem and a major agent of environmental change .  In the Abdaly region of northern Kuwait there are some 156 farms which are separated by desert and thus exposed to sandstorms , where metal wind - breaks and <head>shelter</head> - belts have not prevented sand encroachment , largely as Al - Nakshabandi and El - Robee have suggested , due to poor management . Similar problems have occurred in the Al - Wafra region in the south of Kuwait ,  where desert encroachment has led to the abandonment of farms .  Here the annual rate of sand encroachment is  which is in excess of the average annual rate of sand encroachment of   ( Khalaf 1989 )  .

This philosophy ,  though on a far grander scale ,  can be observed in practice in such great gardens as Sissinghurst in Kent and Hidcote Manor in Gloucestershire ,  where similar plants and colour combinations have been placed in walled or hedged parts of the larger garden .  Long narrow plots often adjoin older properties and this can give you the opportunity of working existing trees and shrubs into the new design .

Leonard was not so much brutalised by the experience ,  as anaesthetised :  hence the recollection of only desire throughout his youth .

This leaves generality as a real capacity of the mind .  Philosophers have often been content to assign to the mind features that they are unwilling to ascribe to the physical world .

In so doing ,  they claim that it is not just secondary qualities that are confined to the mind ,  but ,  with them ,  the whole vivid force of the world - as - we - perceive - it ,   -  what some philosophers call the manifest image  of the world  which is intrinsically bound up with the secondary qualities .  David Hume went further ,  transferring causal power from the world of objects to the mind ,  making of it a tendency of the mind to pass from the thing we call the cause to the one we call the effect .

In our brains ,  the cerebrum  ( the part connected to the olfactory ,  and other senses )  controls our subliminal consciousness ,  determining the threshold of our sensory perceptions .  In time ,  spraying on the same scent habitually can make us completely insensitive to it .  By varying your perfume choice with the frequency you change your smalls , you never build up that resistance ( and thereby avoid the risk of all but suffocating colleagues in a crowded lift with too much Shalimar while you still ca n't <head>smell</head> a thing ) . Also ,  hormonal changes during the month can alter the chemistry of a perfume on our skin ,  so what smells great today may be decidedly iffy by next Thursday .  Of course ,  nowadays ,  fashions in fragrance do mirror those in clothes ;  it 's  no coincidence may of the world 's  best - sellers have been created by top designers .

In summer ,  even in a damp house like this ,  there was no need to wear a dressing - gown as thick and bulky as this one and Marie only put it on when her mother was n't around .  This morning ,  before she left for work at eight o'clock ,  her mother had been friendly ,  quite chatty in fact .

One day he arrived to give a new - born filly post - foaling antibiotic and tetanus cover .  When he walked in the stable door accompanied by his usual aroma ,  the foal fastened her ears to the back of her neck and attempted to attack him with feet and teeth !

The smell of meths had an unforeseen affect on the foal ,  and in some strange way stimulated the foal 's  aggressive instinct .

It is only through the most tinted of retrospective spectacles that the 1960s can appear as a golden age ,  and least of all in the deprived areas to which the Report correctly gave so much attention :  We noted the grim approaches ;  incessant traffic noise in narrow streets ;  parked vehicles hemming in the pavement ;  rubbish dumps on waste land nearby ;  the absence of green playing spaces on or near the school sites ;  tiny playgrounds ;  gaunt looking buildings ;  often poor decorative conditions inside ;  narrow passages ;  dark rooms ;  unheated and cramped cloakrooms ;  unroofed outside lavatories ;  tiny staff rooms ;  inadequate storage space with consequent restrictions on teaching materials and therefore methods ;  inadequate space for movement and P.E .  ;  meals in classroom ;  art on desks ;  music only to the discomfort of others in an echoing building ;  non - soundproof partitions between classes ;  lack of smaller rooms for group work ;  lack of spare room for tuition of small groups ;  insufficient display space ;  attractive books kept unseen in cupboards for lack of space to lay them out ;  no privacy for parents wishing to see the head ;  sometimes the head and his secretary sharing the same room ;  and ,  sometimes all around ,  the ingrained grime of generations .

Here is a passage from a classic work on etching and engraving ,  about Drer :  He was <head>solid</head> , scientific , conscious in all his creating , learning his art from masters who were still in the youth of artistic development , his whole work shows a progress towards an ideal which the trammels of Gothic tradition never left him free to attain without a struggle . By the very energy spent in its realisation ,  his accomplishment is all the more intense in its expression .  He recognised the truest limits of the medium in which he worked ,  never allowed technical virtuosity to have the better of the central aim of significant composition ,  and established a balanced style which remains the most perfect model of the line - engraver 's  art .

It showed itself to have a horror of socialism already in the nineteenth century .  But its opposition also had a base in the property - owning ,  rural peasantry ,  and middle - classes ,  who had in the nineteenth century paid a heavy price for their liberation from oppression and whose status became rooted in their property ,  land ,  and livestock .  Their attitudes were shared by their priest - sons , who in their turn were supported by Rome , whose <head>solid</head> opposition to socialism until the 1960s was very clear ( e.g. Pope Leo XIII , 1903 ) . From 1911 to 1914 ,  the Irish high clergy made successive attacks on the trade union movement and on socialism .  Rumpf and Hepburn  ( 1977 )  view the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limiting the appeal of socialism for the Irish subordinate classes until the 1950s .

They get far more than they bargain for .  ( Grillo 1980 :  3 )  In effect , the insider who reveals the structural formations of a system of power inverts that power and the revelation creates a situation where elements of anti - structure ( Turner 1969 , 1974 ) now present a version of how things might be constituted ; and what has been seen as <head>solid</head> reality begins to be identified as only one social possibility . In this observing participation ,  the thick description which Geertz  ( 1975 )  argued for comes hurtling at the ethnographer ,  so that the classic use of an anthropological informant is hardly necessary .  Rather it will be a case of the researcher finding a means of recording and sorting the mass of detail which continuously bombards him and presents him with the lateral possibilities which make the discipline potentially dangerous .

If the ribs  ( sides )  are thinner ,  as suggested  ( about 1.5mm )  hot bending will not be necessary and a better shape can be achieved by the use of a simple jig to hold the ribs while the glue dries .

If the instrument is to be resonant the apparently <head>solid</head> finger board needs to be hollowed out from underneath , leaving about 6mm of wood top and sides and openings cut through the soundboard ( face ) to link this space to the interior of the instrument . If you are using guitar machine heads  ( far more easily adjusted than pegs ,  which also require special tools to fit them accurately )  it is more convenient to modify the shape of the head and fit them only on the left  ( if you are right - handed )  in the manner of Fender guitars .

The upstairs lighting circuit is laid out on the floor of the loft ,  taking care not  to put it under any loft insulation  ( where it could overheat )  ,  and not to put junction boxes where they could be damaged by careless feet .  The downstairs lighting circuit is run under the first - floor floorboards ,  with cables preferably threaded through holes drilled in the centre of joists ,  or clipped to the sides of the joists .  To run cable down to light switches or to wall lights , it will usually be necessary to chase slots in <head>solid</head> walls , though if you are rewiring a house which was originally wired in metal conduit , you may be able to use the existing conduit buried in the plaster leading to light switches to feed the cable down. Chasing solid walls is done with a bolster chisel and club hammer ,  and it is important to keep the cables vertical so that you know where they are .  Ideally ,  cables should be covered with metal half - channel before the plaster is made good with filler or a d - i - y plaster :  you will ,  of course ,  have to redecorate the wall afterwards .

What size should battens for supporting cladding be ,  and how are they fixed ?   Wall battens are usually 38119mm ,  or 5025mm in cross - section ,  and should be fixed to the walls either with masonry nails or with non - rusting screws driven into wallplugs .  Nails should penetrate about 10mm into <head>solid</head> masonry and should not be driven into mortar joints . If you are fixing battens over existing rendering make sure they are long enough to give adequate penetration into the brickwork or blockwork beneath .  While cladding can be fixed directly to existing masonry walls ,  it is good practice to cover them with waterproof building paper first to prevent any moisture that gets behind the cladding from penetrating the wall itself .

What makes a successful indie label ?  Everyone has their own idea but history shows that certain elements are essential to the long term success of an indie .

This is called niche marketing which is a familiar concept in all forms of retailing .

Formal differences in art have been linked to places in varied ways ,  one of the best - known Renaissance contrasts being the stress on line  evident in Florentine art as against the colourist approach of the Venetians ,  a city on water .  Does an English liking for watercolour spring from the country 's  climate ?  Does the flat landscape of the Netherlands impose a special <head>sort</head> of vision on Dutch artists ? The reverse of the coin is internationalism ,  a feature ,  some might say ,  of twentieth - century art ;  not so uncommon either in other periods ,  where art historians struggle heroically to identify differences between the art of one country and another .  Some of these struggles have been inspired by base motives  desires to appropriate art to a national or a political cause .

According to this the picture must have been painted about 1588 ,  with which the style and the age of the sitter agree. From a letter to Francesco Gonzaga ,  written in 1622 and published by A.

This <head>sort</head> of reading is only for the dedicated follower of the history of taste , though any reader particularly interested in a picture may find within a single catalogue entry an acutely discriminating judgement or interesting facts ; for example , Tietze 's entry also points out that Manet so much admired the Tintoretto self - portrait that he made a copy of it . The catalogue raisonn continues to be a key document for authentication of an artist 's  work .

Drama school productions are staged with an awareness of the kind of demands the profession will make ,  and students are naturally anxious to be seen in the final production by people who 're likely to offer them work .

Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar <head>sort</head> of schedule , which means agents are asked to see students ' work over a fairly compressed period . Agents are notified of performances by the schools ,  and they also receive hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances .

From the point of view of the experiencing subject ,  the meaningfulness is not something of which he is conscious ;  all he experiences is ,  first the word red ,  then a mental image :  there is nothing that could count as his internally and introspectably associating them which does not reintroduce the mysterious generality of thought .  It does not help the associationist to press the concept of resemblance to his aid .  It might seem that it would , because it might seem very natural to think that one red thing or image might be taken as standing for red things in general because of its natural resemblance to the other members of the class , this constituting the most fundamental <head>sort</head> of association . But resemblance cannot explain how a thinker could experience one object as standing for another ;  for how could the fact that a particular  datum is similar to other things mean anything to a thinker unless he experienced it as  being like many others  that is ,  unless he grasped it ,  not just as a particular but as  an instance of a kind ?  But this is the very ability for which we are trying to account .

It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .  Some philosophers might suspect that I have not considered the behaviouristic theories in their most sophisticated form .  Would it not make a difference if one identified experience , not with some disposition to overt behaviour , but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminates the various <head>sorts</head> of stimuli within the nervous system ? This is a version of the supposedly post   - behaviourist theory called functionalism ,  which treats mental states as responding to other internal and mental states as well as to external stimuli .  The first thing to notice about functionalism is that it does not fare any better than behaviourism in providing an account of what it is that V knows and BS does not ,  for BS could know all about V 's  functional or covertly behavioural states ;  so there is no lack of knowledge that his deficit could consist in .

The truth is ,  not all exciting stories are properly thrillers .  Being gripped by a narrative is an altogether wider notion than what is presaged by the two - in - one of being outside yet inside Raskolnikov 's  strange smile :  the rehearsal of the murder ,  the murder sequence itself ,  the three long duels with the detective Porfiry ,  the suffering ,  the hesitation ,  the final climb up the police - station stairs .  Dostoevsky 's own attempt to suggest how he disposes his reader in relation to these events goes as follows : Narration by the author , a <head>sort</head> of invisible but omniscient being who nevertheless does n't leave him meaning his hero ' for a moment So ,  after appearing to settle for third - person narrative ,  he doubles back on himself and leaves us to make what we can of an omniscient author who is bound hand and foot to a far from omniscient protagonist .  That he succeeds in having it both ways is our experience of reading his novel in its dominant and thriller aspect .

The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .  Again ,  English departments can be unhelpful about participating in schemes for training academics how to teach ,  claiming that teaching literature is less easily defined and methodologized than teaching engineering or economics .  At a time when a good public image is essential for universities , English is unable to explain itself in ways immediately intelligible to the outsider , is notoriously riven with doubts and disagreements that prevent it from having a shared sense of purpose , and may at intervals erupt into crises that attract the wrong <head>sort</head> of publicity . It is time ,  it is thought ,  for English to organize itself in ways that make it more like a proper academic discipline ,  with clear procedures and goals .  The adjacent social sciences provide the model for a genuine professionalism and accountability .

Certainly the aspiration is not limited in modern times to those who have read Emaux et Cames  ,  the French book that Pound respectfully pillaged for Hugh Selwyn Mauberley  ;  it is to be found in all modern poetries known to me ,  Russian and Polish as well as French ,  and  ( more faintly )  in British and American .  In short ,  what this has to do with modern poetry is very clear ;  what it has to do with modern criticism is not clear at all ,  since that criticism has ,  as we have seen ,  no vocabulary for dealing with it ,  and moves further and further from finding such a vocabulary ,  the more it takes its lead from linguisticians like Saussure and Jakobson .

But it is likely that the professionals who have been responsible for the running of such companies at local level will have been allied to the more liberal group among the upper protestant classes ,  as represented by such families as the O'Neills ,  who have looked to the English public schools for the right sort of education .  Wallis ,  Bruce ,  and Taylor  ( 1986 )  list this mainly landed gentry among the cosmopolitans of Ulster society .

Secondly ,  and in contrast with this respect for the state 's  monopoly of violence ,  because the provisionals seek to destroy the Northern dominance of protestant loyalists with a view to restoring the historic integrity of Ireland ,  there is and will remain substantial support from among the Southern population for the violence the provisionals actually commit in the North .  The belief in the integrity of Ireland is central to the unifying dominant beliefs of the alliance and is clearly distinct from the specificity of statehood .  The dual <head>source</head> of the state 's role in hegemony helps us understand the limitations of the state in respect of the alliance whose power it also represents . This is why collections by the provisionals in public houses were having partial success in the  1970s without too much interference by the Garda ,  the Republic 's  police force .  The collections indicated a wider hidden culture of support for the lads who were at the forefront of the battle to restore national unity ,  in addition to the much smaller party political support they enjoyed in the South .

The source of energy for a muscle contraction is Adenosine Triphosphate  ( A.T.P .  )  and this occurs in very small amounts in human muscle .  Therefore ,  it needs to be rapidly regenerated if exercise is to continue ,  and this regeneration is brought about by a substance called Creatine Phosphate  ( C.P. )  .  The splitting of the A.T.P . and C.P. molecules is the prime <head>source</head> of muscular energy . These processes are anaerobic  ( without oxygen )  and no lactic acid is formed in the muscles .

Once training is underway the glycogen is gradually removed from the muscles to produce energy and is replaced by blood ,  that is the muscles are pumped .  After training has finished the blood supply is reduced and the pump disappears ,  resulting in the muscle being smaller than before the exercise started .  A fresh <head>source</head> of glycogen is then needed to restore the muscles to their original size and to encourage growth of the muscle tissue . Therefore ,  complex carbohydrates are initially more important after a work - out than protein .  Complex carbohydrates are best taken regularly throughout the day so that the glycogen is steadily replaced and built up in the muscles .

Not only does seeing a chair as a three - dimensional object have this character ,  but so does seeing one line as longer in the Mulier - Lyer illusion  ( in which two lines of equal length look unequal when differently slanting lines are drawn at the tips )  despite our knowing that the two lines are really the same length .  Visual illusions are an excellent illustration ,  in fact ,  of the division between a  specialized and autonomous mechanism for seeing and the cognitive system which determines whether we should believe what we see ,  as Helmholtz pointed out over a century ago.

Political balance cannot be achieved by criticizing one party during the mid - term of a parliament and another at election time .

Any time that a wing begins to drop at a stall it is the beginning of a possible spin ,  but the spin can only develop if the wing is kept stalled and the glider is allowed to continue to yaw .  In the UK there has been much discussion about teaching stall recoveries with a view to making it all easier for the beginner to understand and  remember .  It has been suggested that incipient is an unfamiliar word , that associating the stall with a spin might get the student worried , and that to simplify things we should only <head>talk</head> about stalls and spins . Although it is obviously accurate to call an incipient spin a stall with a wing - drop ,  I think that this is trying to avoid the issue ,  which is that it is really the beginning of a spin and at least a potential spin .

Thus our contacts with firemen ,  St John Ambulance men ,  special constables ,  and the like were all used to define them as being somewhat unreal and therefore slightly less than human .  Such groups were said to be like the foreigners in the adjacent forces ,  for it was constantly repeated that many wanted to join us but failed because of some inadequacy .  This was especially true of the Fire Service , our immediate neighbours , and it applied equally to those in the adjacent Gateshead Borough Police and Northumberland Constabulary , who were always <head>talked</head> of as being a lesser breed of mortals . This characteristic supports Peter Evans  ( 1977 )  ,  then The Times 's   Home Affairs correspondent ,  who described the police as being peculiarly tribal by nature .  In the small forces of the late 1950s these separations were made much of ,  with those in the adjacent forces essentially seen as belonging to another tribe .

As it is ,  he slyly suggests that minor artists may look down their noses at major ones and that important work may be left to persons of an inferior kennel ,  like the Russians ,  the Germans ,  the Americans ,  who ,  poor dears ,  know no better .  The great cultural danger for the English is ,  to my mind ,  their tendency to judge the arts by the values appropriate to the conduct of family life .  Among brothers and sisters it is becoming to entertain each other with witty remarks , hoaxes , family games and jokes , unbecoming to be solemn , to monopolize the conversation , to <head>talk</head> shop , to create emotional scenes . But no art ,  major or minor ,  can be governed by the rules of social amenity .

CAMRA is also concerned at the way in which many keg beers are brewed and the ingredients used .  Mashing ,  boiling and fermentation are often speeded up in large breweries using such devices as continuous fermentation and high gravity brewing ,  both of which produce standardised bland beers of mediocre quality .  In order to further speed and cheapen the process , inferior ingredients such as maize , rice , triticale , wheat flour and potato starch are used and helped on their way by chemicals that hasten fermentation , cut down on the yeast head in the vessels to allow more wort to be <head>treated</head> , and to give a lively fake head to the finished product . Beer is classified as a food stuff and yet it is excluded from the legal requirements to list ingredients .  Drinkers have a right to know whether the beer they are drinking is a genuine barley malt product or whether it is stuffed full of such tasty ingredients as corn syrup ,  propylene glycol alginate ,  amyloglucosidase ,  papain enzymes and potassium metabisulphite .

To do these effectively you need either an abdominal board which can be used on an incline ,  or a plank with one end raised on bricks and a piece of rope tied to that end to hook your feet underneath .

English Electric Class 37s in particular were subjected to near - total rebuilds ,  involving replacement of the main generator with an alternator ,  regeared CP7 bogies ,  and in some cases Ruston or Mirrlees power unit ,  electric - heat generator ,  or ballast weights added to provide extra adhesion for particular freight work .

The Class 50 refurbishment programme was completed ,  although they are destined for a short life ,  while limited work was also carried out on Class 20s ,  26s and 33s to see them through to the arrival of new designs .  On reflection ,  costly mistakes were made with both the Class 27s and 45s ,  whose short careers could not possibly have justified the lavish life - extension work carried out on them .

The case of Virgil is a crucial one For anyone for whom literary education  like any other  is an exploration of the meanings we have and live by ,  so far as we do live by meanings ,  Virgil and Dante are connecting rooms To talk of getting the full charge of the Divine Comedy or more modestly and exactly , the fullest charge the particular reader is capable of getting while <head>treating</head> Dante 's master as an irrelevance , is nonsense ; This is part of a polemic  ( reluctant ,  because in other contexts and on other grounds Sisson venerates Pound )  against Ezra Pound 's  treatment of Virgil :   there are such absurdities in Pound as the assertion that Gavin Douglas 's  excellent Aeneidos  is better than the original ,  together with other devaluings of Virgil '  For Eliot and Sisson it is unthinkable that one can venerate Dante without venerating Virgil ,  and vice - versa  ;  whereas Pound was firmly pro - Dante ,  and yet often raucously dismissive of Virgil .

The GDR 's  acceptance as a real country has been the function of the Cold War ,  a piece of make - believe reflecting tacit agreement by both blocs that the German Question is best put on hold .

This has given the East Germans the best standard of living in East Europe .

Most of the constraints ,  however ,  are informal .  With relatively so few policewomen ,  the occupational culture of the force is heavily masculine ,  and the wider cultural values that exist in Northern Ireland generally make men more conservative in their attitudes towards gender and sex roles .  This not only affects how the male public react to policewomen in the province , it also influences how male colleagues <head>treat</head> policewomen in the work environment and the sorts of duties they are assigned in practice ; and the dearth of senior female officers makes it easy for male colleagues to impose such limits on the role of policewomen . The focus here will be on the way gender structures routine police duties ,  with more general issues concerning women in the RUC being developed elsewhere .   The view is widespread among the senior officers we talked to ,  and among ordinary policemen ,  that policewomen ,  as women ,  have instincts and capabilities which make them better suited to specific types of police work .

The view of senior management is that policemen need to combine the qualities of compassion and toughness and know when each is appropri  ate  ( FN 11/11/87 ,  pp. 78 )  ,  although in practice it is difficult to strike this fine balance .  Where it is seen by work colleagues to be getting out of kilter ,  informal controls can be used to restore equilibrium .  Thus , some policemen are urged by their tough - minded colleagues to <head>treat</head> marginal incidents as criminal behaviour and are encouraged into action . The reverse is equally evident ,  for informal controls sometimes operate to moderate the actions of those members of the RUC who see themselves as Rambo in police uniform .  The satirical phrase used to embarrass the Action Men is that they have the John Wayne syndrome ;  the fact it is Wayne rather than Rambo who is used to ridicule them gives a clue that it tends to be the older members of the force who use the term to describe the exuberant younger policemen .

It was the result of efforts to transfer product systematically from developed to less developed economies ,  while at the same time retaining the essentially American management style of strong planning ,  coordination and control from the centre .

Lower trade barriers permitted their development , and Japanese government restrictions on overseas investment encouraged companies that <head>treated</head> markets on a global basis and benefitted from economies of scale . According to Bartlett and Ghoshal ,  the transnational company is meant to be the vehicle for international marketing of the 1990s that integrates the strengths of the three former culturally - dependent types of company .  To some extent the difference between this view and the developmental approach is one of semantics :  the term global company does not mean the same to each .

Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's  successor as professor at Basel ,  but his later successful career took him to Berlin ,  Munich and Zrich ,  a major art historian whose interests were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque .  Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant  of artists ,  but the famous phrase indicated an interest in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition .

It was for this reason that Swangrove came about .  Here in the great saloon ,  light and airy with its tall mullioned windows facing north and south ,  its smart bolection moulding around the panelling and its groaning tables of food ,  the men would congregate and feast after a long morning 's  deer hunting in the park .  They could <head>wash</head> their hands in one of the most glamorous marble basins in England , set in a marble niche with a scallop - shaped roof and with water gushing from the mouth of a mandarin mask .

There is no doubt the uniform policemen see their one - time associates in the CID as having crossed a divide ,  while the detectives know they have joined a closed and somewhat lite family group ,  whose strengths include the inside support of other members of that society .  In many cases becoming a detective relies on a quiet system of patronage ;  of being invited in by those already inside with power .  Having <head>watched</head> and assessed the track record of some young officer , the middle - ranking detectives will perhaps put him forward as a candidate , and I have watched as potential members were admitted only after a series of phone calls had ensured their acceptability to the department . I have also seen written applications for the CID ridiculed by those inside ,  and listened to the expressions of disbelief that these nave applicants were so short of shillings that they did n't realise that admission was by invitation only .  I have also had to tell others they are unlikely to get in and then try to explain the politics of the department to them and watch their dismay when they realize that ,  perhaps regardless of merit ,  they do not fit in .

To describe self - governed perceptual sequences ,  Kant gave the example of scanning the front elevation of a building ;  in doing which we  determine what we see and the order in which we see it  roof ,  front - door ,  top - left - hand window ,  and so forth .  Obviously ,  each kind of experience necessarily contains elements of the other. Thus , there is some degree of selfdetermination in the ship case because we are free to shut our eyes , to cross the river and see it move from right to left , free to jump into the water and <head>watch</head> it coming towards us , free to determine the speed with which it passes across our visual field by moving our eyes with or against its movement . In the house example ,  we can choose the order in which we see the parts of the building but we surely cannot see occluded portions ,  and we surely cannot look up to see a thatched roof  because that 's  the kind of roof we want to see  when the roof is tiled .  In fact ,  in every microsecond of perceptual experience there is a tension between the real as refractory ,  as something we cannot choose or will ,  and the subjective as chosen and willed .

Since females reap substantial protective benefits from associating with alpha males ,  this is perhaps not surprising .

In the one - way mirror treatment , when males were unaware they were being <head>watched</head> , they were more aggressive towards infants than in the clear screen treatment and as a result they received a drubbing from the female . The experiment thus suggests that while alpha males can trade on their superior competitive ability to obtain mates ,  subordinates may have to wheedle their way into favour .

As for the match ,  Rovers conspired to throw a smokescreen of their own around their abilities until they emerged starkly with two clever goals inside three minutes early in the second half to scuttle their scoreless fellow Third Division promotion hopefuls .  First Paul Nixon showed intelligence when he ignored an opportunity to shoot and pulled the ball back instead for the better - placed David Mehew to score and then ,  two minutes later ,  Mehew combined with Devon White before sending over a cross that Gary Penrice ,  a yard out ,  accepted with relish .  Mehew 's contribution probably surprised the scouts , who were almost certainly in Bath to <head>watch</head> Penrice and Nigel Martyn , but it is a fair reflection of his part in pushing Rovers into second place . A prodigious runner ,  Mehew 's  pace and fitness give Rovers the appearance of playing 4 - 4 - 2 and 4 - 3 - 3 at the same time and his willingness to get into the penalty area has brought him four goals already this season .  It has also produced satisfaction for his manager ,  Gerry Francis ,  who rescued Mehew from Bath City 's  reserves two years ago.

Our game really is in danger of dying from too much of it .

One of the major features is a timber - framed house which will be under construction throughout the show ,  allowing visitors to see the various elements and skills involved .  A free seminar programme entitled A step by step guide to building your own home  will also run hourly throughout the show .  And to keep the children amused , a Lego competition will be held in the creche , so that junior selfbuilders can also build their own houses , and perhaps <head>win</head> some Lego , too . Tickets are 5 ,  or 2.50 for senior citizens or children between 5 and 16 .  But anyone booking in advance can get their tickets half - price .

Senna led from the start and ,  apart from a brief skirmish in the opening laps ,  never came under serious pressure .  The Ferrari of Gerhard Berger finished second ,  26 seconds ahead of Alain Prost 's  McLaren .  Prost 's result does little to further his cause in the championship if he has to drop his lower scores but Senna now knows that he must <head>win</head> the final two races in Japan and Australia . Prost ,  meanwhile ,  can do no more and the pressure is now with his team - mate to repeat yesterday 's  performance .  While Senna 's  steady but swift progress made his 20th Grand Prix victory look easy ,  the reigning world champion says this race has been one of the toughest .

In many of these countries the new respect for human rights was embodied in the repeal or revision of laws used to imprison prisoners of conscience .  But there are still prisoners of conscience in Europe ,  and in every other region of the world .  39 of the prisoners featured in the letter <head>writing</head> campaign have been released ; about 50 remain in prison . None of these people should ever have been prisoners of conscience .  Our task today is to increase the international pressure on behalf of the thousands of prisoners of conscience all over the world ,  to make tomorrow the day their freedom is restored .

Your Excellency ,  I am <head>writing</head> as I 'm puzzled as to why you have released Kim Hyun - hui who planted a bomb on a plane and killed 115 people but have imprisoned a girl for taking part in a peace march . To me this is odd as if I were the president of South Korea I would have imprisoned Kim Hyun - hui and released Im Su Kyong as to me Kim Hyun - hui committed the more serious crime .  I would like this to be explained to me as I just do n't understand it .

ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY Do art historians write about the past ,  while art critics write about the present ?  Things are not so simple , as some art historians <head>write</head> well about the present , with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture . They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .

Between these two ridges the fire of the sunset falls along the trough of the sea ,  dyeing it with an awful but glorious light ,  the intense and lurid splendour which burns like gold ,  and bathes like blood .  Along this fiery path and valley ,  the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided ,  lift themselves in dark ,  indefinite ,  fantastic forms ,  each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam Purple and blue , the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of night , which gathers cold and low , advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship as it labours amid the lightening of the sea , its thin mast <head>written</head> upon the sky , in lines of blood I believe ,  if I were reduced to rest Turner 's  immortality upon any single work ,  I should choose this .  Its daring conception ,  ideal in the highest sense of the word ,  is based on the purest truth ,  and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life ,  its colour is almost perfect ,  not one false or morbid hue in any part or line ,  and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition ;  its drawing is as accurate as fearless ;  the ship buoyant ,  bending ,  and full of motion ;  its tones as true as they are wonderful ;  and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions the power ,  majesty and deathfulness of the open ,  deep ,  illimitable sea .

Alfred Barr ,  the first director of the Museum of Modern Art ,  New York ,  is exemplary .  In 1936 ,  for example ,  the Museum put on two crucially important exhibitions ,  on Cubist and Abstract Art  ,  and Fantastic Art ,  Dada ,  Surrealism  .  For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to <head>write</head> a historical essay , but it was Barr 's intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair . In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself ,  Barr 's  commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western art :  The explanation of the kind of art shown in this exhibition may be sought in the deep - seated and persistent interest which human beings have in the fantastic ,  the irrational ,  the spontaneous ,  the marvellous ,  the enigmatic ,  and the dreamlike .

My aim was to investigate the symptoms of decay and perhaps to discover in the capriciousness and the return to chaos a law which would vouchsafe one an insight into the intimate workings of art .  This ,  I confess ,  is to me the real aim of art history .  In 1964 Peter Murray <head>wrote</head> an introduction to a new edition , in which he made an observation about the passage on Bernini 's St Teresa , the sculptural group in Rome which is a key work of the Baroque : Bernini is evidently attempting to render something quite transcendental and something which had never been attempted by a sculptor before that date .  Indeed ,  it is possible to argue that St Teresa 's  mystical ecstasies are themselves something entirely new in the spiritual life of Europe

How beautiful ,  how devoid of everything like the handicraft of art it is  the largeness ,  and yet ingenuity of its effect  the purity of its colour  the truth ,  yet refinement and elegance of the action ,  particularly of the hands  ( in which he particularly excels )  ;  and then ,  a lesson to all high - minded slovens ,  the patient vigilance with which the whole is linked together ,  by touches ,  in some instances small almost as a miniature ,  but like the sparkling of water .  Diaries are perhaps more often a vehicle for complaints .  Here is an American artist <head>writing</head> about his dismay at the work he saw at Paris in 1831 : Although I had been informed that the present French artists were low in merit ,  I did not expect to find them ,  with little exception ,  so totally devoid of it .  I was disgusted in the beginning with their subjects .

If an agent is interested in you he may well have useful comments on the photo you send of yourself ,  on your style and how you present yourself .  Remember this will be a professional opinion from someone who is interested in the qualities you now have to offer ,  so bear such comment well in mind .
