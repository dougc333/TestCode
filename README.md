for my own notes

TestAvro: Avro avsc generator
TestFuture: creating Scala Future via Promise and future{}
TestGradle: transition to Gradle from Makefile, add test nodes
TestGuava: Guava examples; I keep having to write small test code snippets to remember how syntax works
TestGuice: Guice examples. not documented anywhere
TestGuiceHttp: http server Jetty + Guice. Easier than Spring
TestJavaTwitter4J: authentication is hard to debug. Setting up account sucks
TestObservable: javarx, javarx-scala. 
TestSpark: spark wordcount, spark streaming to twitter stream, spark streaming benchmark with spark as data source
TestTwitter2: twitter streaming example; docs are wrong, had to use Holden's example
