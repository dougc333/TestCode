    "There are 2 research problems 1) predict protein structure where given a AA sequence we perdict the 3d shape.  30k genes in human genome, each one codes a different\n",
    "protein. We can look at other easier to study organisms and get clues on protein structure/gene pairs. 2 the inverse problem\n",
    "is given a 3d structure how to predict the AA sequence? Sidechains? The difference is we dont start with a structure in nature\n",
    "we have a design goal for a synthentic protein and we would like to go backwards. \n",

    "both of the above problems going from AA to 3d and synthetic 3d to AA sequecnce are difficult. For each AA there are many\n",
    "rotatable bonds as seen below. Each AA has 3 different rotations. If you have 100 AA then you have 3 rotations for \n",
    "first AA then 3 for the second one, etc.. SO the number of possibilities is 3*3*3.... 100 times 3^100. The number of confirmations\n",
    "is 3^# of residues. The other problem going from structure to number of sequences is hard, each can be 20AA. 20^#res. The third problem\n",
    "is we have to find the minimum energy. These are surrounded by water atoms. Hard. To search through the possible conformations\n",
    "for a 3d struct we iterate through the possible conformations. (movie). Teh second problem of finding the number of sequences\n",
    "we use a Monte Carlo search. \n",
