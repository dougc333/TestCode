to run the d3 files cd into the directory with the index.html and main.js files. 
run python SimpleHTTPServer 8888

the python server will automatically serve the contents of the directory it is running on

from a browser: use http://localhost:8888/index.html

DO NOT USE file:///Users/dc/Downloads/TestD3/index.html

this will load index.html but you will get XHRRequest.. Errors which will make no sense to a beginner
You will see a security request error of the form: 
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

there is also an XHRRequest.. damn can't replicate it when I need it....
