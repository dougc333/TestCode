% This script tests your implementation of MultiStitch.m, and you can also
% use it for generating panoramas from your own images.
% 
% In case generating a panorama takes too long or too much memory, it is
% advisable to resize images to smaller sizes.
%
% You may also want to tune matching criterion and RANSAC parameters in
% order to get better quality panorama.
