    %       So if image 1 is 120x100, column 1 will be length 12000. Column
    %       2 is the same for image 2.
    % imageOwner - a vector of size 1 x numImages, where imageOwner(i)
    %       holds the integer label of image (i). Images from the same
    %       person have the same label.

    %       size) 
    % imgWidth - the width of an original image (they are all the same
