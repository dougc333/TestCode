
function [prinComponents, weightCols] = doPCA(A, numComponentsToKeep)
% Performs PCA on data and returns the principal components (unit vectors
% which can be combined to reproduce each data sample) and the PCA-space
% representation of each data sample (i.e. weights on the principal
% components which would reproduce the sample)
% INPUTS:
%   A - A matrix where each column is a data sample. Its size is
%       sampleDimensionality x numSamples.
%   numComponentsToKeep - How many principal components should be retained.
%       The top few principal components can represent most of the
%       variation in an image set.
% RETURNS:
%   prinComponents - Columns that can be linearly combined to reproduce the
%       input data samples. Size is sampleDimensionality x
%       numComponentsToKeep
%   weightCols - Each column holds the weights necessary to reproduce one
%       input data column. E.g. prinComponents * weightCols(:,1) will
%       produce an approximation of the first column of A. Size is
%       numComponentsToKeep x numSamples
