function headCenters = findHeads( img )
%findHeads Uses skin segmentation together with erosion/dilation to find
%   blobs of skin-colored pixels which are about the right size to be heads.
%   Returns their centers.
%   INPUTS:
%       img - an rgb image
%   OUTPUTS:
%       headCenters - An n x 2 matrix, where n is our estimate of the
%       number of heads. Each row holds the (x,y) coordinates of a head
%       center in the image.

% This defines a default image to use, so you can just hit F5 in the editor
% to test the function
if nargin == 0
    img = imread('heads.jpg');
end

% converts image to YCbCr color space and applies some simple thresholds to
% produce a boolean image which is 1 for skin and 0 for non-skin. The
% result will be far from perfect, as color of one pixel isn't enough, in
% general, to recognize something.
yCbCr=rgb2ycbcr(img);
y = squeeze(yCbCr(:,:,1));
cb = squeeze(yCbCr(:,:,2));
cr = squeeze(yCbCr(:,:,3));
skinInitial = (131 <= cr) & (cr <= 185) & (80 <= cb) & (cb <= 135) & (y<=150);

% Now, use regionprops() to get statistics on the blobs of skin pixels. 
% For example, the command STATS = regionprops(skin,'Centroid') returns an
% array of structs holding the centers of blobs. The array is size
% length(STATS), and you can get the centroid of the ith blob with 
% c = STATS(i).Centroid
% Note that the centroid is in (x,y) order, not the normal MATLAB matrix
% order. Please return your headCenters in that same (x,y) order.
% Read the doc for regionprops() to find other useful statistics that you
% can use to differentiate the heads from arms, hands, and noise.
