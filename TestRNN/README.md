the char-rnn requires torch

Start: http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html#lstm (vague)
Start: Karpathy lecture (good), internal 
Start: 


End: DRAW recurrent neural network for image generattion 
End: visual attention looking at street numbers / can you generalize this for object detection?
