    "it is next to a door. Given this sensing, this transforms the uniform probability distribution to the posterior dist. \n",
    "For the 3 locations near doors there is an increased belief if the robot is near the door. This is a graph of \n",
    "prob from sensor vs. position. The sensors could be errorneous so there is a small probability where there is no door. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) calcuate the prior. After moving some distance to the right, the probablity distribution \n",
    "shifts to the right. We shift the probability to the right after movement using convolution. The peak values of the \n",
    "probability in this graph is less than the posterior graph above. \n",
